       " 'PARMESAN & GARLIC FRIES \\n\\nThese were next level, absolutely unreal.. bursting with flavour, and so easy to make. \\n\\nFirst off follow the below recipe for the perfect chips. \\n\\nWhen your chips are cooked pop them aside and get a large high sided pan and drop in a good size knob of butter, you want it to melt and cover the base of the pan. \\n\\nCrush 3 garlic cloves and drop into the butter as it starts to melt. Keep on a medium heat for a minute or two and then drop your cooked chips in then pan along with a good shake of grated parmesan.. stir / shake and get them all coated. \\n\\nShake over some dill and a little salt and pepper to serve. 🔥 \\n\\nPerfect Airfryer Chips\\n\\n*Don’t worry, if you haven’t got an airfryer you can use the oven (same temp 180). \\n\\nServes 4\\n1kg potatoes\\nLow-calorie spray oil\\n \\n1 - Wash and peel your spuds and cut into chips. I like mine chunky but do them the way you like, whether it’s wedges or skinnier French fries.\\n\\n2 - Pop them in a microwave-safe bowl and give them a good rinse under the tap, then drain ALL the water off; this is very important.\\n\\n3 - Pop them in the microwave and cook on full power for 12–13 minutes (less if making a smaller batch), giving them a good shake halfway through. You want them to be soft to the touch, but not mushy. Don’t worry if they stick, this is just the starch; you can rinse them again in cold water after microwaving and this will unstick them.\\n\\n4 - At this point you can season with paprika or garlic granules, but I like mine plain and simple.\\n\\n5 - Next pop them into the airfryer at 200°C. It will take roughly 15–20 minutes to get them nice and golden, but pay attention to our special trick.\\n\\n6 - Every 5 minutes I open the basket and give the chips a little spray with my oil and a good shake. This ensures they all cook evenly and end up super crispy from the oil. If I’m cooking for a gang and I have to make a few batches, I leave the made ones in a bowl and just as my last batch is ready I throw them all back in together to heat them up.\\n\\n#thedalydish #misterdish #perfectchips #frenchfries #garlicfries #parmesanfries #easyrecipes #quickrecipes',\n",

A little bit of prep work in the morning, let the flavours come together while your meat and veggies marinate all day, fire up the grill that night, and within 20 minutes, your gourmet meal is ready.\\n\\nLamb is one of my favourite meats because it is tender and juicy, especially when cooked to medium-rare.

I have grown accustomed to ordering lamb kebabs when I'm out to dinner because I'm not sure I'm patient enough for the long slow roasting process.\\n\\nThis lamb kebab recipe was perfect because (aside from the 30 minutes it took to break it down- it was my first time, don't judge!), the rest was super quick and easy.

       " 'Instagram reels are the key to gaining growth on the platform so its crucial to know how to successfully create one. Here’s how:\\n\\n1️⃣ Use On-Screen Text and Captions - Adding on-screen text and subtitles to your videos is a no-brainer when it comes to reaching more users. Plus, not only are subtitles great for people who watch without sound, but they’re invaluable for those with hearing difficulties.\\n\\n2️⃣ Use Trends as Inspiration - Similar to TikTok, Reels come and go quite quickly. To hop on a trend before it becomes old news, take a few minutes each morning to scroll through the Instagram Reels tab and other creators’ profiles to see what they’re sharing. Is there anything that seems to consistently pop up — a particular song? An audio clip? A dance trend? If so, click on the music to see how many other creators have used the audio. Scroll through the videos to get an idea of what the trend is.\\n\\n3️⃣ Drive Traffic by Encouraging Viewers to Head to Your Link in Bio - The best way to drive traffic from Reels is by including a clear call-to-action (CTA) that encourages people to head to your link in bio. This could be with on-screen text placement, a verbal call-out, in your video caption, or all of the above. You can also use a link in the bio tool to create a mini landing page with multiple link buttons and clickable images.\\n\\n4️⃣ Find Your Niche and Post Consistently - One of the best ways to gain virality on Instagram Reels is by finding your niche and posting consistently. There are so many Instagram users with a wide range of interests and hobbies. No matter what your brand or business does, there’s a niche for you!\\n\\n5️⃣ Include 3-5 Hashtags - Including 3-5 hashtags can be a great way to help the Instagram algorithm “understand” your content and serve it to relevant audiences. For example, using hashtags like #easyrecipes, #mealideas and #dinnerinspiration will indicate to the Instagram Reels algorithm that your content is about food — which may increase the likelihood of it being served to users who are actively engaging with similar content.',\n",

Remove foil and bake for additional 5 minutes! \\n\\nEnjoy it just like that with a small salad for a nice low carb meal which is how I ate it😋 Or serve with some egg noodles tossed in butter, parmesan & the other half can of fire roasted tomatoes which is how my children enjoyed it😋\\n\\n#recipe #homecooking #madewithlove #homesweethome #homemaking #homemaker #happyhomemaker #casseroles #recipeinthecomments #recipeoftheday #zuchinni #gardening #garden #gardenfresh #homemade #healthy #lowcarb #momlife #easyrecipes #dinner',\n",

       " \"😂Seriously though, who can relate!? Our need for carbs when we are stressed is hardwired into us..\\n\\nWhen we are stressed, we are spending time in a state within the nervous system called 'sympathetic' or 'fight or flight' This state is ruled by cortisol and adrenaline, your stress hormones. \\n\\nOn the other side of things we have the 'parasympathetic nervous state' which is when we are relaxed, calm, not stress eating cakes. This state is ruled by dopamine and GABA, our calm, relaxed hormones. \\n\\nJust as we can have low levels of things like iron and so eat red meat or a take an iron supplement to try to boost our levels, we can have lower levels of dopamine or GABA.\\n\\nThese low levels can impact us more so at certain times of the month than others... Before a period/during menopause our progesterone levels are at a very low point, which means we have less GABA/Dopamine circulating than usual. So our bodies will try to 'help' us with getting us to eat cakes, carbs or chocolate which help us create a little hit of dopamine. \\n\\nWhile it feels good in the moment, it usually means our blood sugar sky rockets and then we end up feeling groggy, tired and grumpy when it comes back down again. High blood sugar also impacts our nervous system, so we can get a bit stuck in a cycle of sorts.\\n\\nSo what's a girl to do when life isn't fair and cake is the answer?! Here's a few tips:\\n\\n💫 Pair sugar with protein/fat e.g. nuts, seeds\\n💫 Taking 4 deep breaths in, hold for 4 and release for 4 seconds engages the vagus nerve and surpasses cortisol release\\n💫 Consider a magnesium glycinate supplement (speak to doc first if you take any meds) \\n💫 Stop having caffeine on an empty stomach - it is spiking your cortisol and contributing to your stress eating. Instead have decaf or have food first\\n\\n#cambridgenutritionist #nutritionistedinburgh #weightloss #womenshealthuk #pcos #hormonalhealth #hormonebalance #wellness #femalehealth #healthyrecipes #recipeideas #nutritionist #onlinenutritionist #nutritionaltherapy #nutritionaltherapist #hormonenutritionist #foodfacts #healthhacks #healthtipsforwomen #menopause #perimenopause #menopausenutritionist #pcosnutritionist #hypothyroid\",\n",

Think different mix-ins, a good balance of sugar & salt. \\n\\n✨I personally like mine to taste a little more like vanilla than most.✨\\n\\n✨What’s important is that a dough like this can freeze easily so it can be prepped in advance & placed in the fridge for up to 2 days, anything longer may dry it out. Or you can freeze it up to 6 months. Personally, I make the dough as I want to cook it, with the add-ins mixed in. Then, I roll into balls & place on a cookie sheet & transfer to freezer for 2 hours. Don’t forget to take them out and place in a sealed freezer bag with date written on the bag. \\n\\n✨You do not have to thaw frozen cookie dough!

I’ve also included caper leaves 🌱 in this salad, a bit more subtle in flavor than the capers themselves. And pistachios🥜 from Aegina bring a pleasantly salty crunch to each bite!\\n\\nI’ve also added 2 fruits to this salad: watermelon 🍉 and peaches 🍑 which are both in-season at the same time as the rest of the Greek salad.

Furthermore, they are high in several beneficial plant compounds, mainly betaine, vulgaxanthin and inorganic nitrates (which are associated with reduced blood pressure). Not only can beetroots lower blood pressure, they can also improve oxygen use, stamina and exercise performance. Beetroots are also high in fibre, which is a good thing, but please note that they also have FODMAPs, which for some can cause digestive problems.\\n\\nCarrots are also packed full of nutrients and are a good source of beta carotene, vitamin K1, fibre, potassium and antioxidants. Carrots have many health benefits and they have been linked to weight loss, lowered cholesterol and improved eye health.\\n\\nThen we have pineapples - an ubebu favourite!

       " \"✨COLLAGEN CHALLENGE...\\n\\nCollagen is a protein found in muscles, tendons, skin, ligaments, and bones. It makes up about 30% to 40% of proteins in the human body.  As we get older our bodies make less of it and lower quality collagen. Skin becomes thinner and sags while ligaments lose their elasticity, joints get stiffer and much more. \\n\\nAs our bodies begin to lose collagen from 30 it’s essential we make sure we are getting enough collagen. The effects become noticeable after several years. Even though this is a natural process, it’s possible to accelerate & slow down collagen loss. \\n\\nThe below can interupt and reduce natural collagen production: \\n🍔 Consuming too much sugary food and refined carbs \\n🚬 Smoking \\n☀️ Exposure to UV rays \\n💦 Pollution\\n\\nAs the amount of collagen decreases, other parts of your body suffer as well:\\n👉 Bones – become weaker and more fragile\\n👉 Joints – cartilage wears out, causing pain & making it tough to stay active\\n👉 Muscles – function decreases affecting mobility and balance\\n\\nCollagen can be found in many foods and also supplements! I love @vitalproteins.uk \\n\\nFoods such as:\\n🍣Fish with skin on\\n🍗Chicken bones \\n🍳Egg whites \\n🍋Fruits and veg, such as citrus fruits, berries, tropical fruits, leafy greens, peppers and tomatoes\\n\\nHow do you make sure you're getting enough collagen? \\n\\n#wellnessjourney #instafit #motivation #supplements #holistichealing #health #healthyhabits #healthyhair #healthysnacks #healthychoices #healthyskin #healthiswealth #healthandwellness #healthcoach #healthyfood #healthybody #healthyliving #healthcare #recipeshare #recipeideas  #easyrecipes #recipeinspo #kentuk #london #tunbridgewells #sevenoaks\",\n",

Cover with cling film and let it marinate for 20 mins at least.\\u2060\\n2. In the meantime prepare a quick guacamole. Add the avocado flesh into a bowl and mash it with a fork. Add the onion, jalapeno, extra virgin olive oil, a pinch of salt and black pepper, then mix and set aside.\\u2060\\n3. In a different bowl prepare a quick pico de gallo. Mix the tomatoes, onion, extra virgin olive oil, lime juice, coriander, salt and pepper.\\u2060\\n4. Get the barbecue going or heat up a cast-iron skillet with the remaining olive oil. Grill or pan-fry your marinated chicken and let it get a bit of colour on both sides. Finish cooking it covered with a lid, to allow it to cook fully without getting dry.\\u2060\\n5. Once ready, remove from the heat and cut the chicken into strips with a sharp knife. Serve your chicken with warm Soft Taco Wraps, a good amount of guacamole and some of the pico de gallo. Finally don’t forget to try some Gran Luchito Salsas!',\n",

Add 2 tsp vanilla essence and 60ml of semi skimmed milk and stir the batter again.\\n5. Fold in 16 Aero melts - 8 melts per portion is 4 syns.\\n6.

Dot them with torn Buffalo mozzarella, top with garlicky, herby, lemony salsa, get your bread out and regret not having more 🙀 Haven’t I mentioned it already? For those wondering about anchovies in salsa they can be successfully substituted with green olives and this is what I did 🤩 Absolutely delicious!

       " \"ASSEMBLE 🍽 DON’T COOK 🤍\\n\\nTruth, I am not at all a great cook…but I am creative, and I love to cook.\\n\\nI did not grow up with a refined palate but did have a mother and grandmother who loved to 'bung it together', as my mum Margot would say. And so, as I developed a love for all things food, I had to start by instinct. I must also confess that I'm terribly lazy and am always trying to find the simple route of favourite dishes. Even the most delicious meals I make rarely take more time than they need to. This is why I follow a simple rule. Assemble the dinner, but don't try to cook it.\\n\\nWe're inundated with perfection these days. Scroll through your Instagram and see how many plates of food have the perfect basil leaf cocked on the perfect forkful of pasta. I would be frustrated to create a meal like this; nobody has time for that!\\n\\nInstead, I don't sweat it. My dinners are platters of messy sauces and imperfectly cut veggies. I will cook grains and throw on top whatever needs to be used up from the veg crisper in my refrigerator. \\n\\nI write this story because on the weekend, In an attempt to impress, I went against my rule and attempted to follow a recipe. LOL.. it was a fail. Place me in a bustling environment of chatter and champers, and well… let's just say I am not great at Muti-tasking. I now know never to go against what makes me feel comfortable in my kitchen. \\n\\nI chalk my mistakes up to one word: rustic. Instead, I make what feels good to make, what gets my hands dirty, and what shows the season's colours. Instead, I tear basil leaves with my hands and call it a day.\\n\\nWhether you are a right or left-brain thinker who doesn't (or does) love cooking, no worries… the trick is to assemble, not cook. Simplify, and you will be healthier and less stressed for it.\\n\\n#nutrition #nutritiontips #simplemeals #simplify #easymeals #healthhacks #healthyfood #healthyrecipes #livnutritious\",\n",
