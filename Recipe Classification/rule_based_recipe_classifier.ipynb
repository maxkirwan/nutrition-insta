It might be a tight squeeze but they will reduce in size as they cook. Cook, undisturbed, until very deeply browned and have reduced in size, 4-5 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side, 4-5 more minutes. Resist the temptation to touch the wedges as they cook. Uninterrupted contact with the frying pan yields a deeply caramelised result. Pour the reserved glaze into the pan and cook, until mostly absorbed, 1 more minute. Some steam will be released as the glaze hits the pan but don’t be alarmed by this.\n",

It’s completely magic, something I’m inordinately grateful to be experiencing but it’s not all glowing rainbows and sparkles, it’s also nausea, bulging boobs and truthfully quite a big of nervousness too ❤️ 1. The changes in your body are incredible, I’m blown away by what my body is creating. I’ve made fingernails and kidneys, a little brain and a tiny heart all whilst going about my daily life - just testament to the wonder that is the female body. That being said it’s an adjustment, within 8 weeks or so my jeans were too tight, my bras too small and everything felt v snug. I was too scared to buy maternity things to start with for fear of jinxing anything and learning to dress something that’s changing day to day can feel challenging and at moments knock your confidence \n",

Literally questioning and worrying all day, feeling a deep sense of responsibility from day 1, with the first 12 weeks being especially scary. Constantly googling everything. \n",
      "5. Burning nipples when it’s cold outside, it actually feels like they’re on fire a little bit\n",
      "6. Dodgy digestion, burping, farting, bloating, heartburn, constipation, reflux and sick burps. I flipped my hair to put it into a towel and sick burped onto the bath mat last week \n",
      "7. Break outs, these were almost the first sign for me \n",

And those microbes have more genetic material than human cells, they help us break down the food that’s not absorbed in our small intestines, help to make vitamins and hormones, train our immune system. These microbes are thought to talk to the brain via the gut-brain axis, and have been linked with better overall physical and mental health.\n",

      "3 tbsp vegetable oil\n",

      "1 heaped tsp black mustard seeds\n",

Add the chilli powder and stir well. Now add the beetroot making sure to stir and mix all the spices. Fry for 2-3 minutes. Season well. Turn the heat to low and add the coconut, remaining curry leaves and fresh coriander. Stir well and serve warm with some rice or paratha.\n",

      "1 . add the smoky chipotle fajita and taco mix onto your chicken breasts with the lime juice, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper. cover with cling film and let it marinate for 20 mins at least.⁠\n",
      "2 . in the meantime prepare a quick guacamole. add the avocado flesh into a bowl and mash it with a fork. add the onion, jalapeno, extra virgin olive oil, a pinch of salt and black pepper, then mix and set aside.⁠\n",
      "3 . in a different bowl prepare a quick pico de gallo. mix the tomatoes, onion, extra virgin olive oil, lime juice, coriander, salt and pepper.⁠\n",
      "4 . get the barbecue going or heat up a cast-iron skillet with the remaining olive oil. grill or pan-fry your marinated chicken and let it get a bit of colour on both sides. finish cooking it covered with a lid, to allow it to cook fully without getting dry.⁠\n",
      "5 . once ready, remove from the heat and cut the chicken into strip with a sharp knife. serve your chicken with warm soft taco wraps, a good amount of guacamole and some of the pico de gallo. finally don’t forget to try some gran luchito salsas!\n",

      "instagram reels are the key to gaining growth on the platform so its crucial to know how to successfully create one. here’s how:\n",
      "\n",
      " use on-screen text and captions - adding on-screen text and subtitles to your videos is a no-brainer when it comes to reaching more users. plus, not only are subtitles great for people who watch without sound, but they’re invaluable for those with hearing difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      " use trends as inspiration - similar to tiktok, reels come and go quite quickly. to hop on a trend before it becomes old news, take a few minutes each morning to scroll through the instagram reels tab and other creators’ profiles to see what they’re sharing. is there anything that seems to consistently pop up — a particular song? an audio clip? a dance trend? if so, click on the music to see how many other creators have used the audio. scroll through the videos to get an idea of what the trend is.\n",
      "\n",
      " drive traffic by encouraging viewers to head to your link in bio - the best way to drive traffic from reels is by including a clear call-to-action (cta) that encourages people to head to your link in bio. this could be with on-screen text placement, a verbal call-out, in your video caption, or all of the above. you can also use a link in the bio tool to create a mini landing page with multiple link buttons and clickable images.\n",
      "\n",
      " find your niche and post consistently - one of the best ways to gain virality on instagram reels is by finding your niche and posting consistently. there are so many instagram users with a wide range of interests and hobbies. no matter what your brand or business does, there’s a niche for you!\n",
      "\n",
      " include 3-5 hashtags - including 3-5 hashtags can be a great way to help the instagram algorithm “understand” your content and serve it to relevant audiences. for example, using hashtags like and will indicate to the instagram reels algorithm that your content is about food — which may increase the likelihood of it being served to users who are actively engaging with similar content.\n",

      "instagram reels are the key to gaining growth on the platform so its crucial to know how to successfully create one. here’s how:\n",
      "\n",
      " use on-screen text and captions - adding on-screen text and subtitles to your videos is a no-brainer when it comes to reaching more users. plus, not only are subtitles great for people who watch without sound, but they’re invaluable for those with hearing difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      " use trends as inspiration - similar to tiktok, reels come and go quite quickly. to hop on a trend before it becomes old news, take a few minutes each morning to scroll through the instagram reels tab and other creators’ profiles to see what they’re sharing. is there anything that seems to consistently pop up — a particular song? an audio clip? a dance trend? if so, click on the music to see how many other creators have used the audio. scroll through the videos to get an idea of what the trend is.\n",
      "\n",
      " drive traffic by encouraging viewers to head to your link in bio - the best way to drive traffic from reels is by including a clear call-to-action (cta) that encourages people to head to your link in bio. this could be with on-screen text placement, a verbal call-out, in your video caption, or all of the above. you can also use a link in the bio tool to create a mini landing page with multiple link buttons and clickable images.\n",
      "\n",
      " find your niche and post consistently - one of the best ways to gain virality on instagram reels is by finding your niche and posting consistently. there are so many instagram users with a wide range of interests and hobbies. no matter what your brand or business does, there’s a niche for you!\n",
      "\n",
      " include 3-5 hashtags - including 3-5 hashtags can be a great way to help the instagram algorithm “understand” your content and serve it to relevant audiences. for example, using hashtags like and will indicate to the instagram reels algorithm that your content is about food — which may increase the likelihood of it being served to users who are actively engaging with similar content.\n",
