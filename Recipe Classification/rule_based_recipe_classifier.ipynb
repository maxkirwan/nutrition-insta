It might be a tight squeeze but they will reduce in size as they cook. Cook, undisturbed, until very deeply browned and have reduced in size, 4-5 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side, 4-5 more minutes. Resist the temptation to touch the wedges as they cook. Uninterrupted contact with the frying pan yields a deeply caramelised result. Pour the reserved glaze into the pan and cook, until mostly absorbed, 1 more minute. Some steam will be released as the glaze hits the pan but don’t be alarmed by this.\n",

It’s completely magic, something I’m inordinately grateful to be experiencing but it’s not all glowing rainbows and sparkles, it’s also nausea, bulging boobs and truthfully quite a big of nervousness too ❤️ 1. The changes in your body are incredible, I’m blown away by what my body is creating. I’ve made fingernails and kidneys, a little brain and a tiny heart all whilst going about my daily life - just testament to the wonder that is the female body. That being said it’s an adjustment, within 8 weeks or so my jeans were too tight, my bras too small and everything felt v snug. I was too scared to buy maternity things to start with for fear of jinxing anything and learning to dress something that’s changing day to day can feel challenging and at moments knock your confidence \n",

Literally questioning and worrying all day, feeling a deep sense of responsibility from day 1, with the first 12 weeks being especially scary. Constantly googling everything. \n",
      "5. Burning nipples when it’s cold outside, it actually feels like they’re on fire a little bit\n",
      "6. Dodgy digestion, burping, farting, bloating, heartburn, constipation, reflux and sick burps. I flipped my hair to put it into a towel and sick burped onto the bath mat last week \n",
      "7. Break outs, these were almost the first sign for me \n",

And those microbes have more genetic material than human cells, they help us break down the food that’s not absorbed in our small intestines, help to make vitamins and hormones, train our immune system. These microbes are thought to talk to the brain via the gut-brain axis, and have been linked with better overall physical and mental health.\n",

      "3 tbsp vegetable oil\n",

      "1 heaped tsp black mustard seeds\n",

Add the chilli powder and stir well. Now add the beetroot making sure to stir and mix all the spices. Fry for 2-3 minutes. Season well. Turn the heat to low and add the coconut, remaining curry leaves and fresh coriander. Stir well and serve warm with some rice or paratha.\n",
