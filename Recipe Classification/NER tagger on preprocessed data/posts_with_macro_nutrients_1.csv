Thanks to all the inspiration here I’m finding ways to still have my cake and eat it (lol!) while not undoing my hard work. I baked this last night to eat this morning and it was yummy! It works out as 4 syns and 320 calories per portion. Recipe below - I made this for me and my husband, so just half the ingredients if it’s just for one person🔻

Ingredients:
16 Aero chocolate melts - 8 melts per person at 1/2 syn per melt (4 syns per portion)
80g oats (40g = 1 HEXb)
60ml semi skimmed milk (1/4 HEXa)
1/3 cup zero calorie sweetener (free)
2 eggs (free)
2 tsp vanilla essence (free)
1 tsp baking powder 

1. Preheat your oven at gas mark 5/6 or 180 degrees Celsius. Grease a baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Blitz your oats in a food processor and then mix into a bowl with 1/3 cup sweetener and 1 tsp baking powder.
3. Crack 2 eggs into the bowl and mix thoroughly.
4. Add 2 tsp vanilla essence and 60ml of semi skimmed milk and stir the batter again.
5. Fold in 16 Aero melts - 8 melts per portion is 4 syns.
6. Pop into the oven for half an hour or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Leave to cool before eating!

Sharing another easy and tasty dish you can enjoy any day of the week! Recently, you guys may have seen my story photos, I had received a wonderful box of Korean products from @kseafoodusa. It included a nice variety of pantry items from Korea: like roasted seaweed, canned tuna, seaweed crackers, nori sheets and more! Thanks to them I was able to make this delicious jeon!! Recipe below!🤗🤗

Ingredients:
Gochu chamchi (spicy tuna) 1 can 
1/2 c diced onion
1/2 T garlic minced
2T scallion, chopped
3/4 buchim garoo (korean pancake mix)
pinch black pepper

1)Open can and drain tuna for 5-10min 
2)Combine all ingredients into a mixing bowl, without over mixing. 
3)Heat pan and cook jeon until golden brown on both sides, in med low heat. Drop about 2tbsp for each jeon. Makes about 9 pc. total. Enjoy with favorite dipping sauce!! 😋😋

These were super tasty and not fishy at all!! I didn't need to add any salt or seasoning since the canned tuna was already seasoned and had a nice savory kick to it!🤗🤗 

And look for these brands if you want to try some high quality Korean seafood!!👍👍

using @properoni_uk Hot Paprika Pepperoni because it’s the BEST🔥

This dish is SO tasty and SO easy. Now, you will need a food processor or meat grinder but apart from that this could not be simpler 💪🏻

- 75g harissa (we are big fans of rose harissa)

2. Stir in the harissa and 250ml water. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes until thickened
3. Stir through the lemon juice and chopped parsley
4. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper
5. Cook the pasta
6. Now to serve. Spread yoghurt over plates/shallow bowls

This process becomes harmful when it becomes chronic, leaving your body in a constant 'alert' mode. Over time, chronic inflammation can damage your healthy cells, tissues and organs. 

Often subtle, symptoms of chronic inflammation can be fatigue, bodily pain, anxiety/depression, gastrointenstinal issues, weight gain/loss and infections

Smoking, obesity, chronic stress and alcohol can contribute to chronic inflammation. Lifestyle changes such as stress management, a healthy diet, plenty of water and exercise can help enormously. 

Help calm your body and fight inflammation by blending up this vibrant anti-inflammatory smoothie that is loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and deliciousness! 

Ingredients:
4 oranges (peeled & cut)

this process becomes harmful when it becomes chronic, leaving your body in a constant 'alert' mode. over time, chronic inflammation can damage your healthy cells, tissues and organs. 

often subtle, symptoms of chronic inflammation can be fatigue, bodily pain, anxiety/depression, gastrointenstinal issues, weight gain/loss and infections

120 g all-purpose flour
½ tsp baking powder
¼ tsp salt
125 g unsalted butter
120 g soft brown sugar
1 large egg
1 tsp vanilla extract
About 24 whole almonds to garnish

METHOD:
Roast almonds at 175 C fan, for 10 minutes. Cool and chop roughly in a small chopper. Set aside until needed.
In a bowl, mix together the oats, flour, baking powder and salt.
In a mixer bowl, cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Mix in egg and vanilla extract. Add oat-flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined. Finally add the almonds and mix again.
With a cookie scoop or spoon, make walnut sized balls and place on oven trays, lined with greaseproof paper or silicon mats. Press each cookie slightly with your hands to flatten slightly. Press a whole almond in the centre.
Cool unbaked cookies in the fridge for 1 hour. After this stage you can either bake them or place in zip-lock bags and store in the freezer.
Bake cookies at 175 C fan (pre-heated) for 13-15 minutes. If baking from the freezer, bake in a non-preheated oven. Cool on a wire rack. Cookies will be soft when hot but will harden as they cool.

8. Zest of a lemon 
9. Jaggery, to sprinkle on top if you please 
10. Raspberry compote: raspberries, honey. Microwave for a couple of minutes, sweeten to your taste using honey. Chill overnight.

Save this post! Full recipe below! 👇

Ingredients: 

2 cups wild rice blend (such as Lundgren’s)
Regular strength chicken or vegetable broth (enough to use instead of water, for cooking rice according to package instructions)
1/4 cup salted butter, sliced
1 large onion, chopped
1 cup thinly sliced baby carrots
2 cups freshly shaved brussels sprouts
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp dry Italian seasoning
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper

Instructions: 

Cook rice according to package instructions, using the broth instead of water. When cook time is up, do not open lid; turn heat off and keep lid tightly covered for 10 minutes to allow continued steaming. If rice is still a bit too firm, mix in just enough extra broth to moisten all rice, cover, and simmer another 10 minutes.
While rice is cooking, add butter to a large/deep skillet over medium high heat. Once butter is melted and starting to bubble, add onion and carrots. Stir to combine.

This quick and easy recipe can transform a monotonous meal into a zesty feast in no time.

Ingredients: Long-grained rice, Olive oil, Onions, Red bell pepper, Garlic, Jalapeño, Cumin, Chicken or vegetable broth, Salt and pepper, Chopped tomatoes or tomato sauce.

1. Wash and drain 200g of rice with a mesh sieve. 
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan. Toss a finely chopped onion, ½ a diced bell pepper, garlic, and a diced jalapeño in it, and give it a quick sauté. Simmer for 10 minutes or until the onions become translucent.
3. Toss in the rice and sauté for 2 minutes, or until it’s toasted and golden brown. Add ½ a teaspoon of cumin, salt, pepper, 400g chopped tomatoes, and 250ml broth to it. If you’re using ketchup instead of tomatoes, add it to the mixture. Stir everything together.
4. Bring the mixture to a boil and cover it with a lid. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes or until the rice is thoroughly cooked.
5. Garnish with chopped cilantro or lime wedges. 

Chef Tip: Mexican rice can be stored in the fridge for up to 5 days. Place it in an airtight container and pop it in the microwave to reheat it, or stir it in a frying pan on the stovetop.

Once you try out this recipe, you won’t be able to go back to plain rice ever again. Serve it for Sunday dinner, and watch the eyes of your loved ones light up with your praises!

Ingredients:
Peanut oil, for frying
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
Kosher salt
1 cup buttermilk
2 teaspoons hot sauce
1 large egg
4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, patted dry
4 tablespoon Nashville Hot Chicken Seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
Lettuce
Mayonnaise

Recipe:
1) Pat Dry Chicken and vacuum seal. Cook Sous Vide 3 Hours at 155. 
2) Pat Dry Chicken and let cool. 
3) Add a scant 1/2 inch of peanut oil to a cast-iron skillet. 
4) Set that over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, set up your dredging station: flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and a pinch of salt in a shallow bowl; buttermilk, hot sauce, egg, and a pinch of salt in another shallow bowl. Whisk each mixture with a fork until well combined.
5) Bread the chicken thighs: First, season the chicken with salt. Now, dredge in the dry mixture, then dunk in the buttermilk, then back into the dry. Fry until golden brown. 
6) While they’re frying, combine the Nashville seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, and black pepper in a heatproof bowl. When you’re done frying the chicken, add about 3/4 cup hot frying oil to the bowl with the spices and whisk until smooth. Dunk the fried chicken in the spiced oil. (If it gets too thick at any point, just thin out with a little more hot oil.)
7) Build the sandwiches! Toss the lettuce with a little mayo and a pinch of salt. Slather a bottom bun half with mayo, then layer with pickles. Top with chicken, then lettuce. Slather a top bun half with more mayo, then close the sandwich and enjoy!

ingredients:
peanut oil, for frying
1 1 /2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
kosher salt
1 cup buttermilk
2 teaspoon hot sauce
1 large egg
4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, patted dry
4 tablespoon nashville hot chicken seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
lettuce
mayonnaise

recipe:
1 ) pat dry chicken and vacuum seal. cook sous vide 3 hours at 155 . 
2 ) pat dry chicken and let cool. 
3 ) add a scant 1/2 inch of peanut oil to a cast-iron skillet. 
4 ) set that over medium-high heat. meanwhile, set up your dredging station: flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and a pinch of salt in a shallow bowl; buttermilk, hot sauce, egg, and a pinch of salt in another shallow bowl. whisk each mixture with a fork until well combined.
5 ) bread the chicken thighs: first, season the chicken with salt. now, dredge in the dry mixture, then dunk in the buttermilk, then back into the dry. fry until golden brown. 
6 ) while they’re frying, combine the nashville seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, and black pepper in a heatproof bowl. when you’re done frying the chicken, add about 3/4 cup hot frying oil to the bowl with the spices and whisk until smooth. dunk the fried chicken in the spiced oil. (if it gets too thick at any point, just thin out with a little more hot oil.)
7 ) build the sandwiches! toss the lettuce with a little mayo and a pinch of salt. slather a bottom bun half with mayo, then layer with pickles. top with chicken, then lettuce. slather a top bun half with more mayo, then close the sandwich and enjoy!

It is a warming and spicy whole food-based meal. We suggested increasing the serving size of the oats and milk if you’re after a more filling brekkie – this makes it more aligned to The Plate Model, with 1 serve carbohydrate and 1 serve protein. Adding some fruit such as fresh or frozen berries is also a great way to get a serve of fruit whilst adding a bit of sweetness!

Ingredients:
1 cup oats, rolled
500ml milk, any
1 tbsp chia seeds
½ tsp cardamom seeds
20g pistachios, chopped

Method:
1. Place all ingredients in a pan and bring it to the boil.
2. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally until the porridge is thick and creamy.
3. Serve as is or top with fresh berries for a serving of fruit. We've topped ours with raspberry compote, which is raspberries, water and 1 tsp sugar simmered over the stove until it thickens.

CHICKEN KARAHI 
by @ataleofsauceandspice 

Ingredients:
3 chicken fillets (can use whole chicken pieces too)
⅓ cup Oil or ghee for cooking 
1 heaped teaspoon ground ginger 
1 heaped teaspoon ground garlic 
1 level teaspoon ground green chillies 
1 teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder 
1 teaspoon ground cumin 
1 teaspoon ground coriander powder 
Salt and pepper to taste 
3-4 large tomatoes (chopped)
2 Tablespoons thick plain yogurt 
Freshly chopped coriander, lemon wedges and ginger julienne for garnish 

Method:
In a wok heat oil/ghee add the chicken along with ginger, garlic and green chillies paste. Let it cook on high heat till the chicken is slightly browned. 
Add the remaining spices and cook for 2 minutes. 
Add the chopped tomatoes mix and let it slow cook on very low heat till the tomatoes are soft and the oil comes to the surface. 
(Keep staring in between to avoid burning at the bottom).

Once the oil is released add yoghurt mix everything and let it simmer for a minute or two. Garnish with ginger and freshly chopped coriander. Serve hot with a squeeze of lemon hot naan or rotis and more plain yogurt on the side if desired. 
Enjoy.

1 tsp baking powder
70g fruit & seed mix 
50g butter

Mix in the dried fruit and seeds. 

Add the beaten egg and then start to add the milk, mixing with a round-bladed knife or fork until you have a soft dough. You may not need all the milk.

Turn out onto a clean floured surface and knead briefly, then roll out to about 3cm thick. Stamp out your scones using a round cutter. Place on a non stick baking tray and brush the tops with a little milk.

Bake for 12-15 minutes until risen and golden brown.

Crescent Roll Taco Ring 🌮 - A fun idea for taco Tuesday! Such an easy dinner idea and I’m already thinking about what else I can make inside a crescent dough wreath! 

Serve with your favorite taco toppings! I used lettuce, sour cream, tomatoes and cheese! 

Ingredients:
- 1 Pound Ground Beef
- ½ Cup White Onion diced
- 1 Package Taco Seasoning Mix 1 oz
- ½ Cup Water
- 1 Cup Shredded Cheddar Cheese
- 2 Crescent-style Dinner Rolls 8 oz can

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2. Heat a large skillet over low-medium heat. Cook the ground beef and onions until the beef is no longer pink. Drain grease if needed, and return meat to the skillet.
3. Add the water and taco seasoning. Continue to cook until the mixture begins to thicken. Remove from heat.
4. Open both cans of dough, unroll, and separate into triangles. Using a large baking sheet or pizza pan lined with parchment paper, place the wide sides of the triangles in the center with the tips overlapping. The center should form a circle. The longer tips of the triangle will face outward, and the end result will look like a sunburst.
5. Spoon the beef around the overlapping portions of the dough to form a large circle. Top the beef with shredded cheese. 
6. Pick up the outer point of a triangle and lay it over the top of the meat and cheese. Tuck the point underneath the inside of the circle of dough so the meat and cheese is covered. Continue this around the circle until all the outer points are folded over and tucked into the center.
8. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes or until the ring is golden brown. Cut into slices and serve with your favorite toppings.

Inspired by spaghetti aglio e olio. With mozzarella and homegrown beetroot on toast. A delicious 30 minute 5-a-day #vegetarian #vegetarianrecipes meal! 

Make it #vegan #veganuk #veganrecipes : omit mozzarella on the toast

For 2
Ingredients:
1. 5-a-day components: 1. Courgette, 160 gm. Sliced. 2. Chard, 160 gm 3. Cabbage, 160 gm 4. Baby broad beans (I used frozen), 160 gm 5. Beetroot, spring onions, 160 gm
2. Garlic, 4 cloves, finely sliced 
3. Chilli, 1, finely chopped 
4. Olive oil 
5. Zest and juice of 2 lemons
6. Honey (optional) 
7. Parsley 
8. Wholewheat spaghetti, 160 gm cooked in a big pot of salted hot water
9. Mozzarella (optional) 

Method:
1. Dry fry courgette for a couple of minutes using high heat. Let it take on a wee bit of colour 
2. Reduce flame to lowest and add a tablespoon of olive oil 
3. Fry the garlic and chilli for a couple of minutes. Add the cabbage and steam fry for 5 minutes. Start cooking your pasta now
4. Add the frozen broad beans and wilt in the chard, cook with lid on for 5 minutes. 
5. Add the spaghetti (Al dente) with a splash of pasta water. Keep flame low and add zest and juice of a lemon. Turn hob off and let the pasta soak up all the delicious veggie juices. Make the salads. 
6. Season to taste and finish with fresh parsley and a final drizzle of extra virgin olive oil 

Beetroot salad: as in previous post so grated beetroot, spring onions with some minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, zest and juice of a lemon, wee pinch of salt (to taste) and a drizzle of honey if you please. 

Make it a #onepotmeal : after step 4, add the spaghetti (use a big, wide pan and don’t break the spaghetti or you won’t be able to slurp!) and a cup of water and cook with lid on. Keep an eye and keep adding water a ladle at a time till spags cooked. I think it’s easier to cook spaghetti separately, just one more pot to rinse off!

Honey-lemon Vinaigrette: 

🍯 Making honey is incredibly resource intensive for a honey bee colony. A worker bee makes 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey during its entire lifetime. It has to consume honey in order to make honey.

🐝Knowing how hard bees work, I strive to use every last drop of honey. When lemon juice is mixed with honey, the acidity of the lemon dilutes the viscous honey, making it possible to get every last sweet drop!

So when I have almost used all of the honey in a jar, I know it is the ideal time to make honey-lemon vinaigrette ~ in the honey jar itself.

Ingredients:
▪️ 1-2 tablespoons of honey
▪️ 2-3 tablespoons of fresh-squeezed lemon juice from 2 lemons
▪️ 2 small garlic gloves, finally chopped
▪️ 2 teaspoons whole grain, old style mustard (optional)
▪️ 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
▪️ Freshly ground pepper
▪️1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
▪️ 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oiltional)

1️⃣ Squeeze 2 lemons with seeds removed
2️⃣ Pour lemon juice in honey jar and shake with lid on vigorously to mix the lemon and honey. This will help integrate the honey into the vinaigrette as you add ingredients.
3️⃣ Add garlic, mustard, sea salt, and ground pepper and shake with lid on vigorously again.
4️⃣ When the honey and other ingredients are well-integrated, add olive oil and leaves of fresh thyme. Shake with lid on again. Adjust salt and pepper to taste.
5️⃣ This salad dressing can be used on any salad, mixed vegetables such as grilled zucchini and summer squash or a pasta salad.
6️⃣ Refrigerate between uses. Let come to room temperature and shake vigorously to serve.

Ingredients:

3-4 boneless skinless, chicken breasts (about 2 Ibs)
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1 medium zucchini
1 medium yellow squash (I used butternut cause it’s all I had in my garden)
1/2 medium sweet yellow onion
1/2 cup pesto prepared 
4 oz parmesan cheese
4 oz mozzarella
Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375 °F.
2. Chop the zucchini, squash, and onion and combine
3. In a large casserole dish, lay the chicken in a flat single layer and season it with the salt, pepper and
garlic powder. Next layer the veggies on and then dollop the pesto over the veggies, then top with the
cheeses.
4. Bake on the middle rack for 35-45 minutes or until chicken is cooked through, 165 F internal temp. If it
starts to brown more than desired, loosely cover with foil until it is done cooking
5. Serve hot and enjoy!

Recipe Notes:
You can cut the chicken in half, chunks, or use chicken tenderloins in lieu of full chicken breasts to make serving easier. Cooking time may be reduced. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container for 3-4 days in the refrigerator or in the freezer for up to a
month.

And yes, there will be a lot of liquid at the bottom, so don’t get discouraged.

THE best summer drink and perfect for those HOT summer days! 🥵

Ingredients: 
1-2 tsp matcha powder (more or less, your preference) 
Milk of choice 
2 tbsp boiling water
Sweetener of choice: stevia, maple syrup, Manuka honey
1 cup of ice

Directions:
In a small bowl, add the matcha powder. Pour in the hot water and whisk until the matcha has fully incorporated into the water. It should be bubbly with no clumps! 

Add ice to a cup. Pour matcha mixture over ice. Add your milk, and sweetener of choice. 

If you have a milk frother, frothing the milk and adding your sweetener then works amazing as well! 

Matcha is high in antioxidants, which help our bodies fight against free radicals that can damage our cells and cause diseases. It also contains vitamin C, selenium, chromium, zinc and magnesium! ✨

the best summer drink and perfect for those hot summer days! 

ingredients: 
1-2 teaspoon matcha powder (more or less, your preference) 
milk of choice 
2 tablespoon boiling water
sweetener of choice: stevia, maple syrup, manuka honey
1 cup of ice

directions:
in a small bowl, add the matcha powder. pour in the hot water and whisk until the matcha has fully incorporated into the water. it should be bubbly with no clumps! 

add ice to a cup. pour matcha mixture over ice. add your milk, and sweetener of choice. 

if you have a milk frother, frothing the milk and adding your sweetener then works amazing as well! 

matcha is high in antioxidants, which help our bodies fight against free radicals that can damage our cells and cause diseases. it also contains vitamin c, selenium, chromium, zinc and magnesium! 

love your live, move your body, nourish your soul .

For those of you who don’t know me, I LOVE @blueribbonsushi LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I moved to New York City in 1998. I was 18 & starting university. After I graduated my first apt was around the corner from the original Blue Ribbon Sushi on Sullivan Street in SoHo. I thought I was so cool, 22 & living alone in SoHo. Real SJP Carrie Bradshaw sh*t goin’ down. I use to go to Blue Ribbon all the time. Dine alone at the bar, read my book or magazine, & I had a crush on the manager Bowie.💚

So here is a shout out to ALL @eatblueribbon restaurants. The Brasserie down the street, the bakery that once was & now all the locations in all the cities. So many great memories & ALWAYS the BEST food. Anyway, enough of my memory lane BS. Truth be told, I ate there the other night, hence the need to recreate this salad that is, yup you guessed it, simple & delicious.🥒🍋🤍

Takeaway, you too can make this. I sub yuzu hot sauce from @traderjoes for thier garlic & habanero sauce & it’s spot on! 

Ingredients:
5 Persian cucumbers, peeled & sliced round 
¼ cup sour cream
2½ tbsp yuzu hot sauce 
Chives, finely chopped
Flaky salt

Directions:
Place your cucumbers in a bowl & set aside. In a small bowl whisk your sour cream, yuzu hot sauce & salt. Then pour over your cucumbers & stir to evenly coat. Add salt to taste, sprinkle your chives on top & serve. 

PS Little Tip(s)… Little Trick(s)…
•If you want to make more, double the recipe.
•You can use scallions instead of chives.
•You can add minced garlic for an extra kick of flavor. 
•Most importantly, do not be afraid to try new things, even if it seems scary or unattainable, if you put your mind to it you can do it… trust me I’m livin’ proof.💥💛

⁠
Probably one of the simplest Indian dishes you  can cook and healthy and cheap too! ⁠
⁠
Lentils are high in fibre, and complex carbohydrates, while low in fat and calories. Their high protein, gluten free whicht makes them a perfect option for those on a low carb diet. ⁠
⁠
This recipe is my go to, and I often change the type of lentils which gives a different texture and flavour to the dish.⁠
⁠
Rayeesa’s Dhal ⁠
⁠
Ingredients:-⁠
⁠
1cup Red split lentils ⁠
½ med onion thinly sliced⁠
2/3 tbsp. ghee (or ½ veg oil + butter) to fry onions ⁠
1 tsp. turmeric ⁠
1tsp. Paprika ⁠
2 tbsp. Garlic and ginger paste⁠
1 ½ tsp Ground coriander ⁠
Salt to taste⁠
Green chillies, 2 small ones chopped (optional)⁠
Fresh coriander to garnish⁠
⁠
Method :-⁠
⁠
Wash lentils thoroughly in clean water⁠
(Leave to soak for ½ hr if possible)⁠

It is a warming and spicy whole food-based meal. We suggested increasing the serving size of the oats and milk if you’re after a more filling brekkie – this makes it more aligned to The Plate Model, with 1 serve carbohydrate and 1 serve protein. Adding some fruit such as fresh or frozen berries is also a great way to get a serve of fruit whilst adding a bit of sweetness!

Ingredients:
1 cup oats, rolled
500ml milk, any
1 tbsp chia seeds
½ tsp cardamom seeds
20g pistachios, chopped

Method:
1. Place all ingredients in a pan and bring it to the boil.
2. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally until the porridge is thick and creamy.
3. Serve as is or top with fresh berries for a serving of fruit. We've topped ours with raspberry compote, which is raspberries, water and 1 tsp sugar simmered over the stove until it thickens.

‼️ 𝗪𝗔𝗥𝗡𝗜𝗡𝗚 - This is 𝘕𝘖𝘛 your 'average' soup recipe!

💚 This recipe was adapted from a recipe featured in the August 'delicious' magazine. Something I LOVE doing, is adapting recipes into a healthy, balanced meal. I adapted this recipe by adding chicken for protein, more veggies and omitting the parmesan to serve, although this is also fine if you choose to add it. 

🍲 💡Healthy food DOES NOT have to be tastless or boring. Remember that recipes can be adapted to become a healthy option. The flavours in this soup were absolutely mouth watering!

🍗 𝗖𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗻, 𝗖𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗶 𝗕𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗩𝗲𝗴 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗽

✴️INGREDIENTS:
1 tbsp olive oil
1 leek, finely sliced
1/2 fennel bulb, thinly sliced
3 garlic cloves, crushed
1/2 tsp fennel seeds
6 sprigs oregano, or 1 1/2 tsp dried leaves
1 parmesan rind (such a genius way of adding flavour without the fat and calories of cheese)
4 cups chicken or veg stock
500g chicken breast, cut into large pieces
400g cannellini beans, drained
1 zucchini, diced
2 sticks celery, chopped
1/2 bunch silverbeet

🍋𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗹𝗲𝘆, 𝗔𝗹𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗮 (optional but super delicious and you only need a tsp or two)
40g almonds, toasted
1/4 bunch flat leaf parsley
2 sprigs oregano, or 1/2 tsp dried leaves
juice of 1/2 lemon
40mL olive oil

✴️METHOD:
1️⃣ Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add leek, fennel, celery, garlic, fennel seeds and oregano and cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes until softened and lightly golden.

2️⃣ Season, add parmesan rind, stock and 1 cup water and bring to a simmer. Add chicken pieces and cook for 10 minutes or until chicken is just cooked through.

3️⃣ Remove chicken pieces and allow to cool slightly. Add zucchini, cannelini beans and silverbeet and stir for 3-4 minutes or until zucchini is just softened. Shred chicken, return to saucepan and stir. 

4️⃣ Meanwhile for the salsa, simply blend together all ingredients in thermomix or food processor.

 𝗪𝗔𝗥𝗡𝗜𝗡𝗚 - this is 𝘕𝘖𝘛 your 'average' soup recipe!

 this recipe was adapted from a recipe featured in the august 'delicious' magazine. something i love doing, is adapting recipes into a healthy, balanced meal. i adapted this recipe by adding chicken for protein, more veggies and omitting the parmesan to serve, although this is also fine if you choose to add it. 

 healthy food does not have to be tastless or boring. remember that recipes can be adapted to become a healthy option. the flavours in this soup were absolutely mouth watering!

ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 leek, finely sliced
1/2 fennel bulb, thinly sliced
3 garlic clove, crushed
1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
6 sprig oregano, or 1 1 /2 teaspoon dried leaves
1 parmesan rind (such a genius way of adding flavour without the fat and calories of cheese)
4 cup chicken or veg stock
500 gram chicken breast, cut into large piece
400 gram cannellini beans, drained
1 zucchini, diced
2 stick celery, chopped
1/2 bunch silverbeet

𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘀𝗹𝗲𝘆, 𝗔𝗹𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗮 (optional but super delicious and you only need a teaspoon or two)
40 gram almonds, toasted
1/4 bunch flat leaf parsley
2 sprig oregano, or 1/2 teaspoon dried leaves
juice of 1/2 lemon
40 ml olive oil

method:
 heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat. add leek, fennel, celery, garlic, fennel seeds and oregano and cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes until softened and lightly golden.

 season, add parmesan rind, stock and 1 cup water and bring to a simmer. add chicken piece and cook for 10 minutes or until chicken is just cooked through.

 remove chicken piece and allow to cool slightly. add zucchini, cannelini beans and silverbeet and stir for 3-4 minutes or until zucchini is just softened. shred chicken, return to saucepan and stir. 

 meanwhile for the salsa, simply blend together all ingredients in thermomix or food processor.

Calories 320, 25g carb, 20g fat, 10g protein.

Ingredients:

Dressing

3 Tbsp. sesame or coconut oil
2 Tbsp. coconut aminos or low-sodium soy sauce
1 Tbsp. raw apple cider vinegar
1/2 tsp. fish sauce
1 tsp. minced fresh ginger
1 large clove garlic, peeled and minced
1.5 tsp. lemongrass paste

Salad

1/8 tsp. sea salt
6 cups kale, chopped (if you don’t have kale, then you can use romaine lettuce or spinach)
1/2-3/4 medium carrot, peeled and shredded or julienned
1/2 cup shredded red cabbage, very thinly sliced
1/2-1 bell pepper (red or yellow), thinly sliced
1 green onion, thinly sliced
3 Tbsp fresh cilantro leaves, chopped
1/4 cup dry roasted cashews, chopped
Lime wedges for garnish

INSTRUCTIONS

Combine dressing ingredients in a small bowl and whisk well to combine. Set aside.
Place kale in a large bowl and sprinkle with sea salt. Using your hands, massage the kale with a kneading motion until leaves start to wilt and become slightly shiny or wet-looking (about 2-3 minutes). Very important to massage the kale this way! It makes it more tender and less bitter.
Add carrots through cilantro, then pour dressing over all. Toss to combine.
Garnish with chopped cashews just before serving. Serve with lime wedges.

Some days you want to indulge in rich, restaurant-like North-Indian food but then you don’t want to indulge in the cooking that it calls for! Nahi? 😂

This ‘Paneer in Cashew & Mawa Gravy’ is the answer to your dilemma! It’s quick to cook, takes less amount of preps and the outcome? 🤤 Words can’t describe it! You’ll know when you try it!

Some hot sizzling rotis to go with it, and you’re good to go! 

Here is the recipe: (perfect for the festive season) 

Ingredients:

Paneer 250 grams
Onion 1 medium chopped
Garlic 3-4 cloves chopped
Cashews 15 pcs
Mawa 100 grams grated (50 + 50) 
Cardamom 2 pc whole
Cinnamon stick 1
Cloves 2
Pepper corns 7-8 pcs
Cumin seeds 1 tsp
Tej patta 1
Milk 1/2 cup
Yogurt 1 tbsp
Garam masala 1 tsp (or kitchen king masala)
Salt to taste
Fresh Cream 2 tbsp
Oil
Ghee

Method:

Step 1: 

Take oil in a pan. Add the whole spices (cardamom, peppercorn, cloves, cinnamon) and sauté garlic and onion in this until soft. Cool down.

Important: Discard the cinnamon. 

Blend into a smooth gravy along with 50 grams Mawa and 15 cashews and a little water. 

Step 2: 

Take ghee in a pan and add cumin seeds and tej patta. Sauté and add the gravy. Cook for 3-4 minutes before adding 1/2 cup milk and grated Mawa (this part of the Mawa is optional) Again cool for 4-5 minutes on low heat and then add 1 tbsp yogurt. 

Keep cooking while adding the salt and garam masala. Now add the cream and the paneer and cook for 2 minutes. Switch off and serve immediately.

(The gravy thickens as it cools down, so if you want you can add milk and cook a little to reach the desired consistency!)

take oil in a pan. add the whole spices (cardamom, peppercorn, clove, cinnamon) and sauté garlic and onion in this until soft. cool down.

important: discard the cinnamon. 

blend into a smooth gravy along with 50 gram mawa and 15 cashews and a little water. 

step 2 : 

take ghee in a pan and add cumin seeds and tej patta. sauté and add the gravy. cook for 3-4 minutes before adding 1/2 cup milk and grated mawa (this part of the mawa is optional) again cool for 4-5 minutes on low heat and then add 1 tablespoon yogurt. 

keep cooking while adding the salt and garam masala. now add the cream and the paneer and cook for 2 minutes. switch off and serve immediately.

(the gravy thickens as it cools down, so if you want you can add milk and cook a little to reach the desired consistency!)

Serves 2
Ingredients:
4 tbsp olive oil divided 
2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice 
1 tbsp lemon zest (optional)
1 tsp paprika
2 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp dried basil
1 tsp dried thyme
3 cloves garlic minced
1 shallot minced
Sea Salt and freshly ground black Pepper 
2lb boneless and skinless chicken thighs cut into one inch chunks
1 red onion
1 red pepper
10 cherry tomatoes halved

Method:
In a large bowl mix 2 tbsp olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, paprika, oregano, basil, thyme, garlic, shallot, 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper. Stir in the chicken and mix it well. Leave for at least 2 hours but preferably leave overnight.

Thread the chicken onto the skewers. Brush on each side with the extra 2 tbsp olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Grill or bbq them. I chose to bbq them, they can be grilled on medium heat. Turn them though out cooking either way you cook them.

It’s been busy and spending the afternoon in the kitchen just hasn’t been an option, or I just haven’t had the energy for it. Honestly, we’ve done more in the last month then we’ve done in the last 3 years it seems! Since coming back from our honeymoon, I’ve slowly been easing myself back to my daily routine and habits, like starting to go on some small runs again, seeing friends, doing the sauna, etc.

Chris is away for the weekend so I decided today was going to be all about me 😈 I spent my Saturday at the market, the library, the beach and the kitchen, and now I’m just about to sit down and have a romantic dinner date with myself 🥰

This is a yam and cherry tomatoes tart with sage and goats cheese. I imagine you can change the produce with the seasons; pumpkin and broccoli for the fall sounds good!

Ingredients:
Pie crust (I had some in my freezer that I’d made earlier)
1 cup ricotta cheese
6 eggs
1 large yam, peeled cubed
1/2 cup sliced cherry tomatoes
Goat cheese, broken into pieces to sprinkle on top
Sage leaves, to sprinkle on top
Salt and pepper

Preheat oven to 400. Roast your yams and bake your crust for 20 minutes or until golden. Place eggs, ricotta, tomatoes and salt and pepper in a bowl, whisk to combine. Remove the crust and yams from the oven, place the yams on the crust then pour mixture overtop. Top egg mixture with goats cheese and sage. Bake for another 25 minutes.

Squash Blossom Vegan Quesadillas! 🌮

Alexa from @alexafuelednaturally created this incredible dish! Check out her recipe below:

RECIPE
Ingredients:
Corn tortillas
10 squash blossoms
Avocado
Salsa
Salt & pepper

""Tofu cheese""
1 (14 ounces) container medium firm or extra firm tofu
2 tbsp olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon
2 tbsp any plant milk (I used oat milk)
1/2 tsp salt
4 tbsp nutritional yeast (I like Trader Joe's brand)
1/2 tsp garlic powder

Instructions:
1. Remove tofu from package and wrap tofu block in 2 paper towels. Squeeze for 10 seconds then break apart tofu into your food processor. To the food processor add salt, 2 tbsp olive oil, lemon juice, nutritional yeast and garlic powder, plant milk. Pulse 6-10 times until you reach the consistency of ricotta cheese like consistency. Taste and adjust salt and seasonings as needed.

2. Clean off each squash blossom with a damp paper towel then trim the stems. In a pan over medium heat, add a tiny bit of oil and quickly cook the squash blossoms 10 seconds on each side. Season with a little salt and pepper.

3. Warm a cast-iron skillet or pan over medium heat. (Optional tip my mama taught me... wait till pan is super hot then quickly dip tortilla in water and add to hot pan. If the pan Doesn't sizzle then it's not ready!!!* flip the tortilla 10-15 seconds later...This makes your tortillas SO SOFT and fresh tasting giving a dry tortilla the moisture it needs. *** only do this tip w/ corn tortillas not flour tortilla***

4. Add a generous spoonful of tofu cheese on half the tortilla, then add squash blossom then fold over. Let cook for 1 minute on both sides.

5. Add sliced avocados and serve with salsa!",,https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/298513931_2352265818248108_238051423081365535_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=f70CBMsm-aQAX_wT83h&edm=AMKDjl4BAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MjkwMTcwODA1NTg1NzAxMjA4Mg%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AT9AOU_mynWSlv6MyzDEFi7I6SYJv293oThAs9O3bMgNhQ&oe=62FB49F4&_nc_sid=1fe099,2901708055857012082,39907221227,Photo,,2022-08-10T11:47:09.645Z,False,,,,en,0.9999952417103628,"over 100 delicious vegan recipes. plant based recipes for muscle growth fat loss and a healthier lifestyle

I needed to make use of some over ripe bananas & came across the banana bread cookies recipe by @mainlymonica on @deliciouslyhealthysweets … I didn’t have a few of the ingredients listed so I altered the recipe and made it my own! Safe to say these banana oaty cookies are my new fave & I’ll be adding them to my morning yoghurt bowl for the foreseeable - the perfect chewy oaty texture, like a flapjack granola!😍

Ingredients:
* 250g ripe banana
* 100g Peanut butter 
* 100g 0% Greek yoghurt 
* 150g @thegreatbritishporridgeco blueberry & banana porridge oats (KG10 for 10% off)
* 80g @freesoulsistas vanilla protein powder 
* 20g maple syrup 
* 1tsp baking powder 

Instructions:
* Preheat oven to 170c & have a lined baking tray set aside
* Mash together banana, peanut butter and yoghurt in a bowl until smooth
* Add in the rest of the ingredients & mix to form a dough (you might need to use your hands)
* Divide dough into balls (50g each) onto the baking tray then flatten into cookies and bake for 20-25mins or until golden!!! mine made 14 cookies! ENJOY!!!

It is a warming and spicy whole food-based meal. We suggested increasing the serving size of the oats and milk if you’re after a more filling brekkie – this makes it more aligned to The Plate Model, with 1 serve carbohydrate and 1 serve protein. Adding some fruit such as fresh or frozen berries is also a great way to get a serve of fruit whilst adding a bit of sweetness!

Ingredients:
1 cup oats, rolled
500ml milk, any
1 tbsp chia seeds
½ tsp cardamom seeds
20g pistachios, chopped

Method:
1. Place all ingredients in a pan and bring it to the boil.
2. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally until the porridge is thick and creamy.
3. Serve as is or top with fresh berries for a serving of fruit. We've topped ours with raspberry compote, which is raspberries, water and 1 tsp sugar simmered over the stove until it thickens.

🕯 loadshedding friendly 

I love this pasta, I chuck in whatever veggies I have lying around. 

- roast butternut (if electricity)
- slow cook tomatoes / I generally air fry on low heat for a while, alternatively fry on stove top.
- fry lots of garlic in lots of olive oil, towards the end add in chopped broccoli 🥦 be careful not to burn
- (if the kids arent eating I usually add chilli flakes) 
- use whatever veggies you want- spinach is also a goodie.

- cook your pasta
- chuck all your veggies in.
- finely chop a packet of mint and flat leaf parsley, toss in just before serving. 

Dish it up. I like to top with avo and goats cheese. And a swirl of olive oil- But totally optional. 

Key ingredients: lots of olive oil, garlic, mint and parsley. If u have those you good to go 👍🏼🤜🏼

Great served the next day for work lunch too.

I am very excited for my sophomore year of college but also low key dreading all the schoolwork and studying I know is coming my way😬 This summer has been very fun and jam packed with internships, my CNA classes, traveling, and having fun with friends and family. This summer has really given me the opportunity to push myself outside of my comfort zone and explore new things about myself.

Add parm cheese to the above if using it.
Add the pasta back in.
Put broccoli on the plate first, then scoop over the pasta mixture so the sauce gets on the broccoli too.

Sometimes the simplest breakfast is the best. That can certainly be said of this delicious recipe that takes the creamy smooth texture of cooked amaranth, the super-grain full of fiber and clean nutrition, and couples it with fresh fruit and subtle hints of spice in a coconut milk confection. It's absolute heaven.  It's easy for any day of the week and the amaranth can be cooked in a rice cooker.  Make it ahead and it is a quick re-heat for busy mornings.

Ingredients:

 1/2 tsp Salt
 2 cups Fresh strawberries
1 cup Fresh blueberries or blackberries
Agave nectar
½ cup Coconut milk
1 tsp Cinnamon
½ tsp Ginger
1-2 Tbsp. Orange zest (1 orange)

Cook the Amaranth

1 cup amaranth
3 cups water
salt to taste (I use about 1 tsp)

Directions:  Combine water and salt in a 1 and a half quart (6 cups) capacity heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid and bring to a boil. Add the grain, cover the pot, and turn the burner to the lowest setting.
Cook covered without stirring for 25 minutes. 

Vegan Breakfast bowls:

To the cooked amaranth pot add ½ cup agave, ½ cup coconut milk, 1 tsp cinnamon, ½ tsp ginger, zest of 1 orange. Divide between 4 bowls. Top each bowl with ½ cup sliced strawberries, ¼ cup blueberries and a drizzle of agave. Enjoy.
