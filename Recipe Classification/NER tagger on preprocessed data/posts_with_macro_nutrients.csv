Sharing another easy and tasty dish you can enjoy any day of the week! Recently, you guys may have seen my story photos, I had received a wonderful box of Korean products from @kseafoodusa. It included a nice variety of pantry items from Korea: like roasted seaweed, canned tuna, seaweed crackers, nori sheets and more! Thanks to them I was able to make this delicious jeon!! Recipe below!ü§óü§ó

Ingredients:
Gochu chamchi (spicy tuna) 1 can 
1/2 c diced onion
1/2 T garlic minced
2T scallion, chopped
3/4 buchim garoo (korean pancake mix)
pinch black pepper

1)Open can and drain tuna for 5-10min 
2)Combine all ingredients into a mixing bowl, without over mixing. 
3)Heat pan and cook jeon until golden brown on both sides, in med low heat. Drop about 2tbsp for each jeon. Makes about 9 pc. total. Enjoy with favorite dipping sauce!! üòãüòã

These were super tasty and not fishy at all!! I didn't need to add any salt or seasoning since the canned tuna was already seasoned and had a nice savory kick to it!ü§óü§ó 

And look for these brands if you want to try some high quality Korean seafood!!üëçüëç

sharing another easy and tasty dish you can enjoy any day of the week! recently, you guys may have seen my story photos, i had received a wonderful box of korean products from . it included a nice variety of pantry items from korea: like roasted seaweed, canned tuna, seaweed crackers, nori sheets and more! thanks to them i was able to make this delicious jeon!! recipe below!

ingredients:
gochu chamchi (spicy tuna) 1 can 
1/2 c diced onion
1/2 t garlic minced
2 t scallion, chopped
3/4 buchim garoo (korean pancake mix)
pinch black pepper

1 )open can and drain tuna for 5-10 min 
2 )combine all ingredients into a mixing bowl, without over mixing. 
3 )heat pan and cook jeon until golden brown on both sides, in med low heat. drop about 2 tablespoon for each jeon. makes about 9 pc. total. enjoy with favorite dipping sauce!! 

these were super tasty and not fishy at all!! i didn't need to add any salt or seasoning since the canned tuna was already seasoned and had a nice savory kick to it! 

and look for these brands if you want to try some high quality korean seafood!!

This process becomes harmful when it becomes chronic, leaving your body in a constant 'alert' mode. Over time, chronic inflammation can damage your healthy cells, tissues and organs. 

Often subtle, symptoms of chronic inflammation can be fatigue, bodily pain, anxiety/depression, gastrointenstinal issues, weight gain/loss and infections

Smoking, obesity, chronic stress and alcohol can contribute to chronic inflammation. Lifestyle changes such as stress management, a healthy diet, plenty of water and exercise can help enormously.

We visited the Lindisfarne Priory @englishheritage and what a wonderful experience this was! In picture 4 I have attempted to write ‚Äúlove to cook‚Äù using Lindisfarne alphabet. Picture 5 is perhaps of interest only to @n.mcdonald2 

Standing in the middle of the Priory kitchen and bakehouse I felt like baking something fresh and fruity. Also got ourselves some delicious raspberry curd and this was so very tasty with our #homemadecheesecake . On our way to the car park we also bought some delicious local strawberries. 

@englishheritage , I hope it is OK for me to post some pictures of the Priory kitchen, bakehouse and brewhouse. I sought permission at the visitor centre and was told it would be fine. If not please let me know and I will remove these. 

For 6-8 portions. 
Ingredients:
1. Good quality cream. I used organic cream from @baysleaporganic. 3 tablespoons 
2. Lighter, high protein cream cheese. X 2 165 gm tubs
3. 2 eggs, I used organic eggs
4. 3 tablespoons self raising flour 
5. Honey, I used English blossom honey from @englishheritage 
6. 2 very ripe bananas 
7. Vanilla extract/ paste, a drop 
8. Zest of a lemon 
9. Jaggery, to sprinkle on top if you please 
10. Raspberry compote: raspberries, honey. Microwave for a couple of minutes, sweeten to your taste using honey. Chill overnight. 

Enjoy with some fruit curd, eg: raspberry curd. We got ours from @englishheritage visitors shop 

Method: 
1. Combine bananas, cream cheese, cream, eggs, flour and vanilla extract. Taste and sweeten using honey 
2. Empty into a baking tray lined with moistened baking paper
3. Sprinkle with jaggery and bake at 180C x 20 minutes till the top is golden and more importantly the cheesecake has a mild wobble in the centre. 
4. Turn oven off and keep cheesecake in for another 30-40 minutes 
5. Chill overnight

Ingredients: 

2 cups wild rice blend (such as Lundgren‚Äôs)
Regular strength chicken or vegetable broth (enough to use instead of water, for cooking rice according to package instructions)
1/4 cup salted butter, sliced
1 large onion, chopped
1 cup thinly sliced baby carrots
2 cups freshly shaved brussels sprouts
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp dry Italian seasoning
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper

Instructions: 

Cook rice according to package instructions, using the broth instead of water. When cook time is up, do not open lid; turn heat off and keep lid tightly covered for 10 minutes to allow continued steaming. If rice is still a bit too firm, mix in just enough extra broth to moisten all rice, cover, and simmer another 10 minutes.
While rice is cooking, add butter to a large/deep skillet over medium high heat. Once butter is melted and starting to bubble, add onion and carrots. Stir to combine. Cover and cook 5 minutes,  stirring occasionally. Add brussels sprouts, garlic, Italian seasoning, and black pepper, stirring another 2 minutes until softened. 
Check rice for doneness. Fluff with fork and add to skillet with vegetable mixture, stirring to incorporate. Taste and season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed.
