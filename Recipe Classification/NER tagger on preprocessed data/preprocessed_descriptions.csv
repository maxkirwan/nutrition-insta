method: add butter in your pan, once its melted, add flour and keep wisking, gradually add milk while mixing the mixture, add all your spices and herbs, make sure you’re continuously mixing so there’s no lumps in the sauce. once you get your desired consistency, turn off the flame. 

preparation: in a ovenproof dish, make a layer of your lasagna sheets, top it with your minced mixture, drop some white sauce on it, garnish with mushrooms and olives, put some (a lot) cheese, i used mozzarella and cheddar!

keep repeating the layers! make the last layer of lasagna sheet, mushrooms, olives, oregano and cheese.
bake it for 20-25 mins, once its done, broil it for 5-7 mins or once the cheese is completely melted and the crust is nicely golden! 

tadaaa! done.

3 . toss in the rice and sauté for 2 minutes, or until it’s toasted and golden brown. add 1/2 a teaspoon of cumin, salt, pepper, 400 gram chopped tomatoes, and 250 ml broth to it. if you’re using ketchup instead of tomatoes, add it to the mixture. stir everything together.

crescent roll taco ring - a fun idea for taco tuesday! such an easy dinner idea and i’m already thinking about what else i can make inside a crescent dough wreath! 

serve with your favorite taco toppings! i used lettuce, sour cream, tomatoes and cheese! 

ingredients:
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1/2 cup white onion diced
- 1 package taco seasoning mix 1 oz
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 2 crescent-style dinner rolls 8 ounce can

directions:
1 . preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2 . heat a large skillet over low-medium heat. cook the ground beef and onions until the beef is no longer pink. drain grease if needed, and return meat to the skillet.
3 . add the water and taco seasoning. continue to cook until the mixture begins to thicken. remove from heat.
4 . open both can of dough, unroll, and separate into triangles. using a large baking sheet or pizza pan lined with parchment paper, place the wide sides of the triangles in the center with the tips overlapping. the center should form a circle. the longer tips of the triangle will face outward, and the end result will look like a sunburst.
5 . spoon the beef around the overlapping portions of the dough to form a large circle. top the beef with shredded cheese. 
6 . pick up the outer point of a triangle and lay it over the top of the meat and cheese. tuck the point underneath the inside of the circle of dough so the meat and cheese is covered. continue this around the circle until all the outer points are folded over and tucked into the center.
8 . bake for 18 to 22 minutes or until the ring is golden brown. cut into slice and serve with your favorite toppings.

honey-lemon vinaigrette: 

 making honey is incredibly resource intensive for a honey bee colony. a worker bee makes 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey during its entire lifetime. it has to consume honey in order to make honey.

knowing how hard bees work, i strive to use every last drop of honey. when lemon juice is mixed with honey, the acidity of the lemon dilutes the viscous honey, making it possible to get every last sweet drop!

so when i have almost used all of the honey in a jar, i know it is the ideal time to make honey-lemon vinaigrette ~ in the honey jar itself.

ingredients:
 1-2 tablespoon of honey
 2-3 tablespoon of fresh-squeezed lemon juice from 2 lemons
 2 small garlic gloves, finally chopped
 2 teaspoon whole grain, old style mustard (optional)
 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
 freshly ground pepper
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oiltional)

 squeeze 2 lemons with seeds removed
 pour lemon juice in honey jar and shake with lid on vigorously to mix the lemon and honey. this will help integrate the honey into the vinaigrette as you add ingredients.
 add garlic, mustard, sea salt, and ground pepper and shake with lid on vigorously again.
 when the honey and other ingredients are well-integrated, add olive oil and leaves of fresh thyme. shake with lid on again. adjust salt and pepper to taste.
 this salad dressing can be used on any salad, mixed vegetables such as grilled zucchini and summer squash or a pasta salad.
 refrigerate between uses. let come to room temperature and shake vigorously to serve.

1767,"spicy cucumber salad, blue ribbon sushi style 

for those of you who don’t know me, i love love! love! love! i moved to new york city in 1998 . i was 18 & starting university. after i graduated my first apt was around the corner from the original blue ribbon sushi on sullivan street in soho. i thought i was so cool, 22 & living alone in soho. real sjp carrie bradshaw sh*t goin’ down. i use to go to blue ribbon all the time. dine alone at the bar, read my book or magazine, & i had a crush on the manager bowie.

so here is a shout out to all restaurants. the brasserie down the street, the bakery that once was & now all the locations in all the cities. so many great memories & always the best food. anyway, enough of my memory lane bs. truth be told, i ate there the other night, hence the need to recreate this salad that is, yup you guessed it, simple & delicious.

takeaway, you too can make this. i sub yuzu hot sauce from for thier garlic & habanero sauce & it’s spot on! 

ingredients:
5 persian cucumbers, peeled & sliced round 
1/4 cup sour cream
21/2 tablespoon yuzu hot sauce 
chives, finely chopped
flaky salt

directions:
place your cucumbers in a bowl & set aside. in a small bowl whisk your sour cream, yuzu hot sauce & salt. then pour over your cucumbers & stir to evenly coat. add salt to taste, sprinkle your chives on top & serve. 

ps little tip(s)… little trick(s)…
•if you want to make more, double the recipe.
•you can use scallions instead of chives.
•you can add minced garlic for an extra kick of flavor. 
•most importantly, do not be afraid to try new things, even if it seems scary or unattainable, if you put your mind to it you can do it… trust me i’m livin’ proof."

2453,"are you ready for the air fryer revolution?

the first thing you need to know about air fryers is that they don’t actually fry things. once you place your food in the frying basket, the machine blows hot air to create a convection cooking effect that browns the food. the crunchy texture is similar to what you would achieve by deep frying.

if you running out the door to be next in line to buy an air fryer or already own one, here is a super easy, delicious chicken recipe to try. 
tender and juicy air fryer chicken is golden crispy outside and moist and delicate on the inside. 
bursting with flavor and oh so good! 

prep time: 10 mins
cook time: 18 mins

ingredients:
2 skinless chicken breasts
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon italian seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
salt and pepper
optional: vegetables (brussel sprouts, carrots, green beans)

method:
place the chicken in the air fryer basket. rub olive oil on the chicken.
in a small bowl add the italian seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper. rub on each sides of the chicken.
cook in the air fryer at 200 degrees for 9 minutes. open the air fryer and flip the chicken. 
add the vegetables at this point if using. 
cook for another 9 minutes or until chicken is done.
enjoy with some spicy rice or garlic rolls.

chris is away for the weekend so i decided today was going to be all about me i spent my saturday at the market, the library, the beach and the kitchen, and now i’m just about to sit down and have a romantic dinner date with myself 

this is a yam and cherry tomatoes tart with sage and goats cheese. i imagine you can change the produce with the seasons; pumpkin and broccoli for the fall sounds good!

ingredients:
pie crust (i had some in my freezer that i’d made earlier)
1 cup ricotta cheese
6 eggs
1 large yam, peeled cubed
1/2 cup sliced cherry tomatoes
goat cheese, broken into piece to sprinkle on top
sage leaves, to sprinkle on top
salt and pepper

preheat oven to 400 . roast your yams and bake your crust for 20 minutes or until golden. place eggs, ricotta, tomatoes and salt and pepper in a bowl, whisk to combine. remove the crust and yams from the oven, place the yams on the crust then pour mixture overtop. top egg mixture with goats cheese and sage. bake for another 25 minutes.

3 . warm a cast-iron skillet or pan over medium heat. (optional tip my mama taught me... wait till pan is super hot then quickly dip tortilla in water and add to hot pan. if the pan doesn't sizzle then it's not ready!!!* flip the tortilla 10-15 seconds later...this makes your tortillas so soft and fresh tasting giving a dry tortilla the moisture it needs. *** only do this tip w/ corn tortillas not flour tortilla***

123,"fennel is a very unique tasting vegetable. super high in nutrients and minerals and especially great for supporting healthy skin.​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
being antiseptic in nature, fennel seed is great for oily and acne-prone skin types because it can remove the dirt and bacteria often causing oil buildup and breakouts. ​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
it contains vitamins a, c, and e, which is an awesome combination for dark spots and wrinkles.​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
my favourite way to eat fennel is as a roasted side dish to some fish or in a risotto.​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
as a roasted side dish you can whip up a marinate using the following ingredients :​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
 3 tablespoon olive oil​​​​​​​​
 2 clove garlic minced​​​​​​​​
 3/4 teaspoon salt​​​​​​​​
 1 teaspoon black pepper​​​​​​​​
 1 teaspoon thyme​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
lay roughly 2 large bulb on parchment paper-lined baking sheet and add them to a pre-heated oven at about 200 degrees.​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
cook for about 35 minutes, and a further 5-10 if they haven't softened enough. ​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
if you eat dairy, you can add sprinkled parmesan over the top after about 25 minutes in.​​​​​​​​

full recipe here
​
​ingredients:
​
serves 2 
200 gram dried pasta
1 tablespoon salt
70 gram crusty bread
2 tablespoon olive oil
30 gram butter
70 gram hazelnuts
1 garlic clove cracked open
150 gram asparagus
150 gram taleggio cheese
1 handful of parsley chopped
​
here’s how:
​
cook the pasta in a large pan of salted, boiling water for 9-10 minutes.
meanwhile snap the asparagus in half and where it naturally breaks that’s where it's tender and put to one side.
chop the bread up into small piece and place on a non-stick baking tray.
pour over a drizzle of oil and bake in a pre-heated oven at 170 c for 10 minutes or just until crisp.
meanwhile melt the butter in a large pan with the cracked garlic clove.
chop the hazelnuts into chunks and add to the pan with the butter and garlic.
lift out a ladle of pasta water and add to the butter with a little black pepper.
this will make an emulsion-style sauce.
lay the asparagus into the sauce and pop the lid onto the pan to speed up the cooking process without evaporating the sauce too much.
when the pasta has cooked for 9 minutes, lift out of the water and add to the pan.
stir together and top with chopped parsley and diced cheese.
finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and scatter over the breadcrumbs.

2258,"are you ready for the air fryer revolution?

the first thing you need to know about air fryers is that they don’t actually fry things. once you place your food in the frying basket, the machine blows hot air to create a convection cooking effect that browns the food. the crunchy texture is similar to what you would achieve by deep frying.

if you running out the door to be next in line to buy an air fryer or already own one, here is a super easy, delicious chicken recipe to try. 
tender and juicy air fryer chicken is golden crispy outside and moist and delicate on the inside. 
bursting with flavor and oh so good! 

prep time: 10 mins
cook time: 18 mins

ingredients:
2 skinless chicken breasts
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon italian seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
salt and pepper
optional: vegetables (brussel sprouts, carrots, green beans)

method:
place the chicken in the air fryer basket. rub olive oil on the chicken.
in a small bowl add the italian seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper. rub on each sides of the chicken.
cook in the air fryer at 200 degrees for 9 minutes. open the air fryer and flip the chicken. 
add the vegetables at this point if using. 
cook for another 9 minutes or until chicken is done.
enjoy with some spicy rice or garlic rolls.

2996,"fennel is a very unique tasting vegetable. super high in nutrients and minerals and especially great for supporting healthy skin.​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
being antiseptic in nature, fennel seed is great for oily and acne-prone skin types because it can remove the dirt and bacteria often causing oil buildup and breakouts. ​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
it contains vitamins a, c, and e, which is an awesome combination for dark spots and wrinkles.​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
my favourite way to eat fennel is as a roasted side dish to some fish or in a risotto.​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
as a roasted side dish you can whip up a marinate using the following ingredients :​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
 3 tablespoon olive oil​​​​​​​​
 2 clove garlic minced​​​​​​​​
 3/4 teaspoon salt​​​​​​​​
 1 teaspoon black pepper​​​​​​​​
 1 teaspoon thyme​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
lay roughly 2 large bulb on parchment paper-lined baking sheet and add them to a pre-heated oven at about 200 degrees.​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
cook for about 35 minutes, and a further 5-10 if they haven't softened enough. ​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
if you eat dairy, you can add sprinkled parmesan over the top after about 25 minutes in.​​​​​​​​
​​​​​​​​
alternatively, you could add nutritional yeast or vegan parmesan. ​​​​​​​​

​
​ingredients:
​
serves 2 
200 gram dried pasta
1 tablespoon salt
70 gram crusty bread
2 tablespoon olive oil
30 gram butter
70 gram hazelnuts
1 garlic clove cracked open
150 gram asparagus
150 gram taleggio cheese
1 handful of parsley chopped
​
here’s how:
​
cook the pasta in a large pan of salted, boiling water for 9-10 minutes.
meanwhile snap the asparagus in half and where it naturally breaks that’s where it's tender and put to one side.
chop the bread up into small piece and place on a non-stick baking tray.
pour over a drizzle of oil and bake in a pre-heated oven at 170 c for 10 minutes or just until crisp.
meanwhile melt the butter in a large pan with the cracked garlic clove.
chop the hazelnuts into chunks and add to the pan with the butter and garlic.
lift out a ladle of pasta water and add to the butter with a little black pepper.
this will make an emulsion-style sauce.
lay the asparagus into the sauce and pop the lid onto the pan to speed up the cooking process without evaporating the sauce too much.
when the pasta has cooked for 9 minutes, lift out of the water and add to the pan.
stir together and top with chopped parsley and diced cheese.
finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and scatter over the breadcrumbs.
