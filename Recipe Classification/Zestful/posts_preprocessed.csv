Ingredients:
Gochu chamchi (spicy tuna) 1 can 
1/2 c diced onion
1/2 T garlic minced
2T scallion, chopped
3/4 buchim garoo (korean pancake mix)
pinch black pepper

1)Open can and drain tuna for 5-10min 
2)Combine all ingredients into a mixing bowl, without over mixing. 
3)Heat pan and cook jeon until golden brown on both sides, in med low heat. Drop about 2tbsp for each jeon. Makes about 9 pc. total. Enjoy with favorite dipping sauce!! üòãüòã

These were super tasty and not fishy at all!! I didn't need to add any salt or seasoning since the canned tuna was already seasoned and had a nice savory kick to it!ü§óü§ó

I‚Äôve recently injured my knee again and currently I‚Äôm baking as a way to cope. These muffins took less then 30 minutes and I‚Äôm not ashamed to say these will be gone by tonight:.)

Ingredients:
2 ripe bananas, mashed 
1/3 cup olive oil 
1/2 cup maple syrup 
2 eggs 
1/2 tsp vanilla 

2 cups flour 
1/2 tsp baking powder 
1 tsp baking soda 
1/2 tsp salt 

Preheat oven to 350

using @properoni_uk Hot Paprika Pepperoni because it‚Äôs the BESTüî•

This dish is SO tasty and SO easy. Now, you will need a food processor or meat grinder but apart from that this could not be simpler üí™üèª

Ingredients: 
- 2 whole pepperoni sausages, casings removed and finely chopped in a food processor
- 1 bunch flat-leaf parsley chopped
- 75g harissa (we are big fans of rose harissa)
- Juice of 2 lemons
- 500g pasta (we used pappardelle)
- 280g thick Greek-style yoghurt

Steps:
1. Add ground pepperoni and parsley stalks to a frypan over medium-low heat and cook, stirring until crispy
2. Stir in the harissa and 250ml water. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes until thickened
3. Stir through the lemon juice and chopped parsley
4. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper
5. Cook the pasta
6. Now to serve. Spread yoghurt over plates/shallow bowls
7. Add pasta on top, and spoon over meat sauce
8. Finish with reserved parsley and lemon juice

This process becomes harmful when it becomes chronic, leaving your body in a constant 'alert' mode. Over time, chronic inflammation can damage your healthy cells, tissues and organs. 

Often subtle, symptoms of chronic inflammation can be fatigue, bodily pain, anxiety/depression, gastrointenstinal issues, weight gain/loss and infections

Smoking, obesity, chronic stress and alcohol can contribute to chronic inflammation. Lifestyle changes such as stress management, a healthy diet, plenty of water and exercise can help enormously. 

Help calm your body and fight inflammation by blending up this vibrant anti-inflammatory smoothie that is loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and deliciousness! 

Ingredients:
4 oranges (peeled & cut) 
2 carrots (peeled & cut) 
Ginger (half thumb or 1/4 tsp ginger powder)

This dessert has been inspired by our visit to the Holy Island of Lindisfarne 

We visited the Lindisfarne Priory @englishheritage and what a wonderful experience this was! In picture 4 I have attempted to write ‚Äúlove to cook‚Äù using Lindisfarne alphabet. Picture 5 is perhaps of interest only to @n.mcdonald2 

Standing in the middle of the Priory kitchen and bakehouse I felt like baking something fresh and fruity. Also got ourselves some delicious raspberry curd and this was so very tasty with our #homemadecheesecake . On our way to the car park we also bought some delicious local strawberries. 

@englishheritage , I hope it is OK for me to post some pictures of the Priory kitchen, bakehouse and brewhouse. I sought permission at the visitor centre and was told it would be fine. If not please let me know and I will remove these. 

For 6-8 portions. 
Ingredients:
1. Good quality cream. I used organic cream from @baysleaporganic. 3 tablespoons 
2. Lighter, high protein cream cheese. X 2 165 gm tubs
3. 2 eggs, I used organic eggs
4. 3 tablespoons self raising flour 
5. Honey, I used English blossom honey from @englishheritage 
6. 2 very ripe bananas 
7. Vanilla extract/ paste, a drop 
8. Zest of a lemon 
9. Jaggery, to sprinkle on top if you please 
10. Raspberry compote: raspberries, honey. Microwave for a couple of minutes, sweeten to your taste using honey. Chill overnight. 

Enjoy with some fruit curd, eg: raspberry curd. We got ours from @englishheritage visitors shop 

Method: 
1. Combine bananas, cream cheese, cream, eggs, flour and vanilla extract. Taste and sweeten using honey 
2. Empty into a baking tray lined with moistened baking paper
3. Sprinkle with jaggery and bake at 180C x 20 minutes till the top is golden and more importantly the cheesecake has a mild wobble in the centre.

Save this post! Full recipe below! üëá

Ingredients: 

2 cups wild rice blend (such as Lundgren‚Äôs)
Regular strength chicken or vegetable broth (enough to use instead of water, for cooking rice according to package instructions)
1/4 cup salted butter, sliced
1 large onion, chopped
1 cup thinly sliced baby carrots
2 cups freshly shaved brussels sprouts
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp dry Italian seasoning
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper

Instructions: 

Cook rice according to package instructions, using the broth instead of water. When cook time is up, do not open lid; turn heat off and keep lid tightly covered for 10 minutes to allow continued steaming. If rice is still a bit too firm, mix in just enough extra broth to moisten all rice, cover, and simmer another 10 minutes.
While rice is cooking, add butter to a large/deep skillet over medium high heat. Once butter is melted and starting to bubble, add onion and carrots. Stir to combine. Cover and cook 5 minutes,  stirring occasionally. Add brussels sprouts, garlic, Italian seasoning, and black pepper, stirring another 2 minutes until softened. 
Check rice for doneness. Fluff with fork and add to skillet with vegetable mixture, stirring to incorporate. Taste and season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed.

Ingredients:
Peanut oil, for frying
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
Kosher salt
1 cup buttermilk
2 teaspoons hot sauce
1 large egg
4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, patted dry
4 tablespoon Nashville Hot Chicken Seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
Lettuce
Mayonnaise

Recipe:
1) Pat Dry Chicken and vacuum seal. Cook Sous Vide 3 Hours at 155. 
2) Pat Dry Chicken and let cool. 
3) Add a scant 1/2 inch of peanut oil to a cast-iron skillet. 
4) Set that over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, set up your dredging station: flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and a pinch of salt in a shallow bowl; buttermilk, hot sauce, egg, and a pinch of salt in another shallow bowl. Whisk each mixture with a fork until well combined.
5) Bread the chicken thighs: First, season the chicken with salt. Now, dredge in the dry mixture, then dunk in the buttermilk, then back into the dry. Fry until golden brown. 
6) While they‚Äôre frying, combine the Nashville seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, and black pepper in a heatproof bowl. When you‚Äôre done frying the chicken, add about 3/4 cup hot frying oil to the bowl with the spices and whisk until smooth. Dunk the fried chicken in the spiced oil. (If it gets too thick at any point, just thin out with a little more hot oil.)
7) Build the sandwiches! Toss the lettuce with a little mayo and a pinch of salt. Slather a bottom bun half with mayo, then layer with pickles. Top with chicken, then lettuce. Slather a top bun half with more mayo, then close the sandwich and enjoy!

CHICKEN KARAHI 
by @ataleofsauceandspice 

Ingredients:
3 chicken fillets (can use whole chicken pieces too)
‚Öì cup Oil or ghee for cooking 
1 heaped teaspoon ground ginger 
1 heaped teaspoon ground garlic 
1 level teaspoon ground green chillies 
1 teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder 
1 teaspoon ground cumin 
1 teaspoon ground coriander powder 
Salt and pepper to taste 
3-4 large tomatoes (chopped)
2 Tablespoons thick plain yogurt 
Freshly chopped coriander, lemon wedges and ginger julienne for garnish 

Method:
In a wok heat oil/ghee add the chicken along with ginger, garlic and green chillies paste. Let it cook on high heat till the chicken is slightly browned. 
Add the remaining spices and cook for 2 minutes. 
Add the chopped tomatoes mix and let it slow cook on very low heat till the tomatoes are soft and the oil comes to the surface.

Once the oil is released add yoghurt mix everything and let it simmer for a minute or two. Garnish with ginger and freshly chopped coriander. Serve hot with a squeeze of lemon hot naan or rotis and more plain yogurt on the side if desired. 
Enjoy.

1 tsp baking powder
70g fruit & seed mix 
50g butter
100ml milk 
1 egg 

METHOD:

Preheat the oven to 210¬∞C / 200¬∞C fan.

Sift the flours and baking powder into a mixing bowl and, using your fingertips, rub in the butter until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. 

Mix in the dried fruit and seeds. 

Add the beaten egg and then start to add the milk, mixing with a round-bladed knife or fork until you have a soft dough. You may not need all the milk.

Turn out onto a clean floured surface and knead briefly, then roll out to about 3cm thick. Stamp out your scones using a round cutter. Place on a non stick baking tray and brush the tops with a little milk.

Bake for 12-15 minutes until risen and golden brown.

Crescent Roll Taco Ring üåÆ - A fun idea for taco Tuesday! Such an easy dinner idea and I‚Äôm already thinking about what else I can make inside a crescent dough wreath! 

Serve with your favorite taco toppings! I used lettuce, sour cream, tomatoes and cheese! 

Ingredients:
- 1 Pound Ground Beef
- ¬Ω Cup White Onion diced
- 1 Package Taco Seasoning Mix 1 oz
- ¬Ω Cup Water
- 1 Cup Shredded Cheddar Cheese
- 2 Crescent-style Dinner Rolls 8 oz can

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2. Heat a large skillet over low-medium heat. Cook the ground beef and onions until the beef is no longer pink. Drain grease if needed, and return meat to the skillet.
3. Add the water and taco seasoning. Continue to cook until the mixture begins to thicken. Remove from heat.
4. Open both cans of dough, unroll, and separate into triangles. Using a large baking sheet or pizza pan lined with parchment paper, place the wide sides of the triangles in the center with the tips overlapping. The center should form a circle. The longer tips of the triangle will face outward, and the end result will look like a sunburst.
5. Spoon the beef around the overlapping portions of the dough to form a large circle. Top the beef with shredded cheese. 
6. Pick up the outer point of a triangle and lay it over the top of the meat and cheese. Tuck the point underneath the inside of the circle of dough so the meat and cheese is covered. Continue this around the circle until all the outer points are folded over and tucked into the center.
8. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes or until the ring is golden brown. Cut into slices and serve with your favorite toppings.

Inspired by spaghetti aglio e olio. With mozzarella and homegrown beetroot on toast. A delicious 30 minute 5-a-day #vegetarian #vegetarianrecipes meal! 

Make it #vegan #veganuk #veganrecipes : omit mozzarella on the toast

For 2
Ingredients:
1. 5-a-day components: 1. Courgette, 160 gm. Sliced. 2. Chard, 160 gm 3. Cabbage, 160 gm 4. Baby broad beans (I used frozen), 160 gm 5. Beetroot, spring onions, 160 gm
2. Garlic, 4 cloves, finely sliced 
3. Chilli, 1, finely chopped 
4. Olive oil 
5. Zest and juice of 2 lemons
6. Honey (optional) 
7. Parsley 
8. Wholewheat spaghetti, 160 gm cooked in a big pot of salted hot water
9. Mozzarella (optional) 

Method:
1. Dry fry courgette for a couple of minutes using high heat. Let it take on a wee bit of colour 
2. Reduce flame to lowest and add a tablespoon of olive oil 
3. Fry the garlic and chilli for a couple of minutes. Add the cabbage and steam fry for 5 minutes. Start cooking your pasta now
4. Add the frozen broad beans and wilt in the chard, cook with lid on for 5 minutes. 
5. Add the spaghetti (Al dente) with a splash of pasta water. Keep flame low and add zest and juice of a lemon. Turn hob off and let the pasta soak up all the delicious veggie juices. Make the salads. 
6. Season to taste and finish with fresh parsley and a final drizzle of extra virgin olive oil 

Beetroot salad: as in previous post so grated beetroot, spring onions with some minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, zest and juice of a lemon, wee pinch of salt (to taste) and a drizzle of honey if you please. 

Make it a #onepotmeal : after step 4, add the spaghetti (use a big, wide pan and don‚Äôt break the spaghetti or you won‚Äôt be able to slurp!) and a cup of water and cook with lid on. Keep an eye and keep adding water a ladle at a time till spags cooked. I think it‚Äôs easier to cook spaghetti separately, just one more pot to rinse off!

Honey-lemon Vinaigrette: 

üçØ Making honey is incredibly resource intensive for a honey bee colony. A worker bee makes 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey during its entire lifetime. It has to consume honey in order to make honey.

üêùKnowing how hard bees work, I strive to use every last drop of honey. When lemon juice is mixed with honey, the acidity of the lemon dilutes the viscous honey, making it possible to get every last sweet drop!

So when I have almost used all of the honey in a jar, I know it is the ideal time to make honey-lemon vinaigrette ~ in the honey jar itself.

Ingredients:

honey-lemon vinaigrette: 

 making honey is incredibly resource intensive for a honey bee colony. a worker bee makes 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey during its entire lifetime. it has to consume honey in order to make honey.

knowing how hard bees work, i strive to use every last drop of honey. when lemon juice is mixed with honey, the acidity of the lemon dilutes the viscous honey, making it possible to get every last sweet drop!

so when i have almost used all of the honey in a jar, i know it is the ideal time to make honey-lemon vinaigrette ~ in the honey jar itself.

ingredients:
 1-2 tablespoon of honey
 2-3 tablespoon of fresh-squeezed lemon juice from 2 lemons
 2 small garlic gloves, finally chopped
 2 teaspoon whole grain, old style mustard (optional)
 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
 freshly ground pepper
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oiltional)

 squeeze 2 lemons with seeds removed
 pour lemon juice in honey jar and shake with lid on vigorously to mix the lemon and honey. this will help integrate the honey into the vinaigrette as you add ingredients.
 add garlic, mustard, sea salt, and ground pepper and shake with lid on vigorously again.
 when the honey and other ingredients are well-integrated, add olive oil and leaves of fresh thyme. shake with lid on again. adjust salt and pepper to taste.

Ingredients:

3-4 boneless skinless, chicken breasts (about 2 Ibs)
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1 medium zucchini
1 medium yellow squash (I used butternut cause it‚Äôs all I had in my garden)
1/2 medium sweet yellow onion
1/2 cup pesto prepared 
4 oz parmesan cheese
4 oz mozzarella
Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375 ¬∞F.
2. Chop the zucchini, squash, and onion and combine
3. In a large casserole dish, lay the chicken in a flat single layer and season it with the salt, pepper and
garlic powder. Next layer the veggies on and then dollop the pesto over the veggies, then top with the
cheeses.
4. Bake on the middle rack for 35-45 minutes or until chicken is cooked through, 165 F internal temp. If it
starts to brown more than desired, loosely cover with foil until it is done cooking
5. Serve hot and enjoy!

Recipe Notes:
You can cut the chicken in half, chunks, or use chicken tenderloins in lieu of full chicken breasts to make serving easier. Cooking time may be reduced. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container for 3-4 days in the refrigerator or in the freezer for up to a
month.

And yes, there will be a lot of liquid at the bottom, so don‚Äôt get discouraged.

For those of you who don‚Äôt know me, I LOVE @blueribbonsushi LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I moved to New York City in 1998. I was 18 & starting university. After I graduated my first apt was around the corner from the original Blue Ribbon Sushi on Sullivan Street in SoHo. I thought I was so cool, 22 & living alone in SoHo. Real SJP Carrie Bradshaw sh*t goin‚Äô down. I use to go to Blue Ribbon all the time. Dine alone at the bar, read my book or magazine, & I had a crush on the manager Bowie.üíö

So here is a shout out to ALL @eatblueribbon restaurants. The Brasserie down the street, the bakery that once was & now all the locations in all the cities. So many great memories & ALWAYS the BEST food. Anyway, enough of my memory lane BS. Truth be told, I ate there the other night, hence the need to recreate this salad that is, yup you guessed it, simple & delicious.ü•íüçãü§ç

Takeaway, you too can make this. I sub yuzu hot sauce from @traderjoes for thier garlic & habanero sauce & it‚Äôs spot on! 

Ingredients:
5 Persian cucumbers, peeled & sliced round 
¬º cup sour cream
2¬Ω tbsp yuzu hot sauce 
Chives, finely chopped
Flaky salt

Directions:
Place your cucumbers in a bowl & set aside. In a small bowl whisk your sour cream, yuzu hot sauce & salt. Then pour over your cucumbers & stir to evenly coat. Add salt to taste, sprinkle your chives on top & serve. 

PS Little Tip(s)‚Ä¶ Little Trick(s)‚Ä¶
‚Ä¢If you want to make more, double the recipe.
‚Ä¢You can use scallions instead of chives.
‚Ä¢You can add minced garlic for an extra kick of flavor. 
‚Ä¢Most importantly, do not be afraid to try new things, even if it seems scary or unattainable, if you put your mind to it you can do it‚Ä¶ trust me I‚Äôm livin‚Äô proof.üí•üíõ

INGREDIENTS:
- 16 oz mild Italian sausage
- 2 cups mushroom (sliced)
- 1 small red onion (diced)
- 1 clove minced garlic
- 4 cups spinach
- 1 cup brie cheese (cubed)
- 10 eggs
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp green goddess seasoning (can omit)
- salt
- pepper
- 1 can crescent roll

STEPS:
1. Start by preheating the oven to 350 degrees.  While the oven is preheating, brown the sausage, slice the mushrooms, and dice the onion.

Servings: 4
Calories 320, 25g carb, 20g fat, 10g protein.

Ingredients:

Dressing

3 Tbsp. sesame or coconut oil
2 Tbsp. coconut aminos or low-sodium soy sauce
1 Tbsp. raw apple cider vinegar
1/2 tsp. fish sauce
1 tsp. minced fresh ginger
1 large clove garlic, peeled and minced
1.5 tsp. lemongrass paste

Salad

1/8 tsp. sea salt
6 cups kale, chopped (if you don‚Äôt have kale, then you can use romaine lettuce or spinach)
1/2-3/4 medium carrot, peeled and shredded or julienned
1/2 cup shredded red cabbage, very thinly sliced
1/2-1 bell pepper (red or yellow), thinly sliced
1 green onion, thinly sliced
3 Tbsp fresh cilantro leaves, chopped
1/4 cup dry roasted cashews, chopped
Lime wedges for garnish

INSTRUCTIONS

Combine dressing ingredients in a small bowl and whisk well to combine. Set aside.
Place kale in a large bowl and sprinkle with sea salt. Using your hands, massage the kale with a kneading motion until leaves start to wilt and become slightly shiny or wet-looking (about 2-3 minutes). Very important to massage the kale this way! It makes it more tender and less bitter.
Add carrots through cilantro, then pour dressing over all. Toss to combine.
Garnish with chopped cashews just before serving. Serve with lime wedges.

Some days you want to indulge in rich, restaurant-like North-Indian food but then you don‚Äôt want to indulge in the cooking that it calls for! Nahi? üòÇ

This ‚ÄòPaneer in Cashew & Mawa Gravy‚Äô is the answer to your dilemma! It‚Äôs quick to cook, takes less amount of preps and the outcome? ü§§ Words can‚Äôt describe it! You‚Äôll know when you try it!

Some hot sizzling rotis to go with it, and you‚Äôre good to go! 

Here is the recipe: (perfect for the festive season) 

Ingredients:

Paneer 250 grams
Onion 1 medium chopped
Garlic 3-4 cloves chopped
Cashews 15 pcs
Mawa 100 grams grated (50 + 50) 
Cardamom 2 pc whole
Cinnamon stick 1
Cloves 2
Pepper corns 7-8 pcs
Cumin seeds 1 tsp
Tej patta 1
Milk 1/2 cup
Yogurt 1 tbsp
Garam masala 1 tsp (or kitchen king masala)
Salt to taste
Fresh Cream 2 tbsp
Oil
Ghee

Method:

Step 1: 

Take oil in a pan. Add the whole spices (cardamom, peppercorn, cloves, cinnamon) and saut√© garlic and onion in this until soft. Cool down.

Important: Discard the cinnamon. 

Blend into a smooth gravy along with 50 grams Mawa and 15 cashews and a little water. 

Step 2: 

Take ghee in a pan and add cumin seeds and tej patta. Saut√© and add the gravy. Cook for 3-4 minutes before adding 1/2 cup milk and grated Mawa (this part of the Mawa is optional) Again cool for 4-5 minutes on low heat and then add 1 tbsp yogurt. 

Keep cooking while adding the salt and garam masala. Now add the cream and the paneer and cook for 2 minutes. Switch off and serve immediately.

(The gravy thickens as it cools down, so if you want you can add milk and cook a little to reach the desired consistency!)

Squash Blossom Vegan Quesadillas! üåÆ

Alexa from @alexafuelednaturally created this incredible dish! Check out her recipe below:

RECIPE
Ingredients:
Corn tortillas
10 squash blossoms
Avocado
Salsa
Salt & pepper

""Tofu cheese""
1 (14 ounces) container medium firm or extra firm tofu
2 tbsp olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon
2 tbsp any plant milk (I used oat milk)
1/2 tsp salt
4 tbsp nutritional yeast (I like Trader Joe's brand)
1/2 tsp garlic powder

Instructions:
1. Remove tofu from package and wrap tofu block in 2 paper towels. Squeeze for 10 seconds then break apart tofu into your food processor. To the food processor add salt, 2 tbsp olive oil, lemon juice, nutritional yeast and garlic powder, plant milk. Pulse 6-10 times until you reach the consistency of ricotta cheese like consistency. Taste and adjust salt and seasonings as needed.

2. Clean off each squash blossom with a damp paper towel then trim the stems. In a pan over medium heat, add a tiny bit of oil and quickly cook the squash blossoms 10 seconds on each side. Season with a little salt and pepper.

3. Warm a cast-iron skillet or pan over medium heat. (Optional tip my mama taught me... wait till pan is super hot then quickly dip tortilla in water and add to hot pan. If the pan Doesn't sizzle then it's not ready!!!* flip the tortilla 10-15 seconds later...This makes your tortillas SO SOFT and fresh tasting giving a dry tortilla the moisture it needs. *** only do this tip w/ corn tortillas not flour tortilla***

4. Add a generous spoonful of tofu cheese on half the tortilla, then add squash blossom then fold over. Let cook for 1 minute on both sides.

5. Add sliced avocados and serve with salsa!",,https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/298513931_2352265818248108_238051423081365535_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=f70CBMsm-aQAX_wT83h&edm=AMKDjl4BAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MjkwMTcwODA1NTg1NzAxMjA4Mg%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AT9AOU_mynWSlv6MyzDEFi7I6SYJv293oThAs9O3bMgNhQ&oe=62FB49F4&_nc_sid=1fe099,2901708055857012082,39907221227,Photo,,2022-08-10T11:47:09.645Z,False,,,,en,0.9999973295408493,"over 100 delicious vegan recipes. plant based recipes for muscle growth fat loss and a healthier lifestyle

I needed to make use of some over ripe bananas & came across the banana bread cookies recipe by @mainlymonica on @deliciouslyhealthysweets ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt have a few of the ingredients listed so I altered the recipe and made it my own! Safe to say these banana oaty cookies are my new fave & I‚Äôll be adding them to my morning yoghurt bowl for the foreseeable - the perfect chewy oaty texture, like a flapjack granola!üòç

Ingredients:
* 250g ripe banana
* 100g Peanut butter 
* 100g 0% Greek yoghurt

* 80g @freesoulsistas vanilla protein powder 
* 20g maple syrup 
* 1tsp baking powder 

Instructions:
* Preheat oven to 170c & have a lined baking tray set aside
* Mash together banana, peanut butter and yoghurt in a bowl until smooth
* Add in the rest of the ingredients & mix to form a dough (you might need to use your hands)
* Divide dough into balls (50g each) onto the baking tray then flatten into cookies and bake for 20-25mins or until golden!!! mine made 14 cookies! ENJOY!!!

i needed to make use of some over ripe bananas & came across the banana bread cookies recipe by on ‚Ä¶ i didn‚Äôt have a few of the ingredients listed so i altered the recipe and made it my own! safe to say these banana oaty cookies are my new fave & i‚Äôll be adding them to my morning yoghurt bowl for the foreseeable - the perfect chewy oaty texture, like a flapjack granola!

ingredients:
* 250 gram ripe banana
* 100 gram peanut butter 
* 100 gram 0 % greek yoghurt 
* 150 gram blueberry & banana porridge oats (kg10 for 10 % off)
* 80 gram vanilla protein powder 
* 20 gram maple syrup 
* 1 teaspoon baking powder 

instructions:
* preheat oven to 170 c & have a lined baking tray set aside
* mash together banana, peanut butter and yoghurt in a bowl until smooth
* add in the rest of the ingredients & mix to form a dough (you might need to use your hands)
* divide dough into balls (50 gram each) onto the baking tray then flatten into cookies and bake for 20-25 mins or until golden!!! mine made 14 cookies! enjoy!!!

I rarely bake with friends but always love when I do! My childhood friends Lauren & Audrey requested to make snickerdoodles, so I had to get my favorite recipe from my friend @alldayhuang. These are the perfect fluffy, soft cookies. She‚Äôs letting me share her recipe, so give it a try! The only modification I made was decreasing sugar, as always (her recipe uses 400g (2 cups) of sugar). 

Ingredients (for about 66 cookies):
- 488g (3¬æ cups) all-purpose flour
- ¬Ω tsp baking soda
- ¬Ω tsp cream of tartar
- ¬Ω tsp salt
- 227g (1 cup) unsalted butter 
- 300g (1¬Ω cups) sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 60g (¬º cup) milk
- 1 tsp vanilla
Cinnamon sugar: 
- 3 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon

1. In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt. 
2. In a stand mixer, beat butter for 30 seconds. 
3. Add the sugar and beat until fluffy. 
4. Add eggs, milk, and vanilla, beating until well combined.
5. Add dry ingredients, beating until well combined. 
6. Form dough into 1-inch balls and roll them in the cinnamon sugar mixture. 
7. Place balls 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet; flatten slightly with the bottom of a drinking glass.
8. Bake at 375¬∞F for about 8 minutes or until lightly golden.

Ingredients:
Tomato and Mascarpone sauce 
Whole wheat Fusilli 
1/2 onion (red or white)
2 cloves of garlic 
Vegetables that need using up! (I used baby plum tomatoes and peas)

Method:
Put pasta on and cook according to instructions. Mine took about 13mins. Make sure to salt your water! Some say like the sea but I only do a few twists of my salt.

Finely dice your 1/2 onion (see third photo for size) and saut√© until fragrant and translucent.

Then add your vegetables to also saut√©.

Chop/mince your garlic and add them vegetables are almost cooked.

When the garlic is fragrant and lightly browned, add a portion of your sauce (mine was about 1/2 the pot).

Add some pasta water to the sauce as it cooks.

Check pasta and when done, drain and add to the sauce.

Mix for about 1min on a medium heat and then serve up!

Place the cheese, onion, breadcrumbs, flour, cilantro and paprika in a large bowl, stir a little and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Drain the corn kernels in a colander, add them to the bowl, stir well until the ingredients are evenly distributed and free of lumps.
Add the beaten eggs, stir once more, using a spatula with smooth and enveloping movements so that the eggs retain the air they have acquired.
In a non-stick frying pan, heat a splash of oil, trying to cover the entire surface.  Add 2 tablespoons of the preparation per pancake (This is just a suggestion, add the amount depending on the size you want the corn pancakes), give it a circular shape.
Let cook for approximately 2 minutes over medium heat, turn and fry for another 2 additional minutes on the other side.

Boiled a dozen eggs for 20 minutes in a large pan and then transfer them to an ice bath. Allow them to cool for 15 minutes. Cut your eggs in half and scoop the yellow portion out into a medium sized bowl. Then add mayonnaise, mustard, and ground black pepper to the bowl. With a fork mix up the ingredients until creamy. Top your eggs off with paprika. I find it easiest to sprinkle it on with my fingers.

Chop the hazelnuts into chunks and add to the pan with the butter and garlic.
Lift out a ladle of pasta water and add to the butter with a little  black pepper.
This will make an emulsion-style sauce.
Lay the asparagus into the sauce and pop the lid onto the pan to speed up the cooking process without evaporating the sauce too much.
When the pasta has cooked for 9 minutes, lift out of the water and add to the pan.
Stir together and top with chopped parsley and diced cheese.
Finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and scatter over the breadcrumbs.¬†
