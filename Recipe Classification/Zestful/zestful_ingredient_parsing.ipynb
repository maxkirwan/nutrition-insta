    "# Using a subscription based service for ingredient parsing\n",

    "Zestful is a subscription based service which uses a prebuilt NER model to parse ingredients. It offers the parsing of 30 ingredients for free per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it only intakes single lines of text relating to one ingredient:\n",
    "\n",
    "       - 3 red peppers, finely chopped\n",

    "       - 1 tin of baked beans\n",
    "       \n",
    "Therefore, this service will only be of use if singular ingredient lines can be retrieved from the text descriptions. This is a difficult task, as the posts come in a variety of formats. Here I shall focus on the most common formats of ingredient lists from the posts, i.e. those which are preceded by the word `ingredients` and are seperated by `\\n` characters:\n",
