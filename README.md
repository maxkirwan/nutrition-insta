Investigating the way nutritional information is disseminated to the public via Instagram.


This GitHub repository is for work done on my thesis for the Data Science MSc at the University of Bristol.

The aim of the project is to build a prototype dashboard to better understand how information about nutrition is being disseminated to the public by high-impact users via Instagram.
This work will develop a methodology for gathering, cleaning and analysing data from Instagram that contains nutritional information, which in turn can be used to build a user-friendly dashboard to inform nutritionists and health policy makers.
