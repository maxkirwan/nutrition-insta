We became parents (twice) during our time here - Matthew was actually sitting in the office behind us (of the second pic) when I told him I was pregnant with May. We’ve found our way through Brexit, a global pandemic, and many other crises. It’s been hard, really really hard at points, but it’s also allowed us to grow, to learn, and to figure out who we really are and exactly what we want to achieve at deliciously ella. This space has been the stage for a seminal chapter of our lives and we’re incredibly grateful for that.

It might be a tight squeeze but they will reduce in size as they cook. Cook, undisturbed, until very deeply browned and have reduced in size, 4-5 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side, 4-5 more minutes. Resist the temptation to touch the wedges as they cook. Uninterrupted contact with the frying pan yields a deeply caramelised result. Pour the reserved glaze into the pan and cook, until mostly absorbed, 1 more minute. Some steam will be released as the glaze hits the pan but don’t be alarmed by this.\n",

      "\n",
      "5. Place the pan back over a medium high heat and add the remaining 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Once it is hot and shimmering spoon the pancake batter into the centre of the pan, making sure the spring onions are evenly dispersed across the surface of the pancake. Cook, until the edges are turning golden brown and crispy and you can see some small bubbles appearing on the surface of the pancake, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook, until dark golden brown, 3-4 minutes.\n",

      "1. Preheat the oven to 180C (355F), fan setting. Line 2x 23cm cake tins with baking parchment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Place the flour, lemon zest, orange zest, ground almonds, coconut sugar and poppy seeds into a large bowl and whisk until there are no lumps.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Pour in the melted coconut oil, maple syrup, almond milk and mix well until a smooth batter forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Divide the mixture between the two lined cake tins and bake for 25-30 minutes until golden and a knife inserted into the middle comes out clean. Once the cakes have cooked, remove from the oven and leave to cool to room temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. While the cakes cook, make the icing. Place the cashews into a bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave to soak for at least 20 minutes in order to let the cashews soften. After 20 minutes, drain and spoon into a powerful food processor.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Add the orange juice, maple syrup and almond milk and blend until a thick icing forms. You may want to add a dash more almond milk if needed to make the mixture blend.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. At this point, spoon half of the icing onto one cake and smooth over before topping with the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Spoon the rest of the icing over the top and sprinkle with orange zest.\n",
