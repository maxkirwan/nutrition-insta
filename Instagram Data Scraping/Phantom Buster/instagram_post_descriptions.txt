So excited to share this with you 💕🌱 What do you think? I felt there was no one-stop-shop for going/being plant-based or flexitarian, a definitive guide with all the resources and expertise that you needed, so I spent the last eighteen months putting it together and it’s finally here 💃 It’s half price on Waterstones and Amazon right now if you want to pre-order it and it launches on the 18th August!

Today marks ten years since @ella.mills__ founded the company, writing our very first recipe post on deliciously ella.com - it was a simple recipe, roasted sweet potatoes with an avocado dip. We’ve evolved a lot since then but the mission hasn’t changed, to help as many people feel better every day. It’s been an adventure, to say the least, and we couldn’t have done it without you. Thank you for the incredible support and for being a part of everything we do 💕💕💕

Introducing @ella.mills__ favourite salad - creamy kale & mushroom salad  
Ingredients: 
A handful of pumpkin seeds
A handful of sunflower seeds
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp of ground cumin
200g mushrooms
200g chestnut mushrooms
200g kale
1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar
1 garlic
2 avocados
2 slices sourdough bread
Pinch of salt

For the dressing:
40g sunflower seeds
60g cashews
100m oat or almond milk
2 tsp Dijon mustard
1 tbsp nutritional yeast
3 tbsp olive oil
Squeeze of lemon

Method:
step 1
Heat the oven to 200C fan. Toss the pumpkin and sunflower seeds on to a baking tray with a tablespoon of olive oil, some salt and the cumin. Roast for about 5 minutes, until crunchy,

step 2
Place the mushrooms in a large frying pan over a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous sprinkling of salt. Let them sauté while you make the salad, stirring them every now and again until they turn golden brown.

step 3
Place the kale in a large mixing bowl, then remove any thick stems and tear the leaves in to pieces.

step 4
Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the apple cider vinegar and a sprinkling of salt and rub them into the leaves using your hands. Massage the kale for a minute or so, being really firm, so that it softens.

step 5
Next, make the dressing. Simply place all the ingredients in a high-speed blender (we use a Nutribullet) and blend until smooth and creamy. p

Our take on that viral Jenifer Aniston salad is now up on our app, and the dressing is 👌👌👌

--------

Five years ago we moved into this office, and we’ve really ridden the waves of life ever since. A few days after we moved in, we learnt that Matthew’s Mum had brain cancer. He navigated the depths of grief while steering a start up through the general chaos of trying to grow a business. We became parents (twice) during our time here - Matthew was actually sitting in the office behind us (of the second pic) when I told him I was pregnant with May. We’ve found our way through Brexit, a global pandemic, and many other crises. It’s been hard, really really hard at points, but it’s also allowed us to grow, to learn, and to figure out who we really are and exactly what we want to achieve at deliciously ella. This space has been the stage for a seminal chapter of our lives and we’re incredibly grateful for that. We trebled in size whilst at this office and we hope to do the same again in the next one, so that we can continue spreading the benefits of natural, plant-based food 🤞Thank you all for supporting us ✨

As the founders of deliciously ella we’re both calling on our government to get a grip. 
You know your health system is broken when the ‘Health Secretary’ jokes about his lack of enthusiasm for healthy eating policies and states that instead of serving healthy food for lunch at an event, he’d much rather serve beers. Health problems related to poor diet, drinking and smoking are reported to cost the NHS in England more than £10 billion a year and disproportionally affect the poorest in our society. As the government turns its back on preventative measures, we’re committed to doing the opposite. From @ella.mills__ and Matthew Mills. 

Here’s what we think he could have served instead: 

	⁃	1 tin of chickpeas, drained 
	⁃	1 teaspoon of ground cumin
	⁃	A big handful of mixed leaves 
	⁃	1 avocado 
	⁃	A handful of sun-dried tomatoes 
For the dressing 
	⁃	3 tablespoons of smooth tahini 
	⁃	2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard 
	⁃	2 tablespoons oat milk
	⁃	Juice 1 lemon 
	⁃	Drizzle of olive oil 
	⁃	Salt and pepper 

	1.	Toss the chickpeas with cumin, olive oil and salt. Roast for 15-20 minutes until crispy 
	2.	Mix the dressing together 
	3.	Once the chickpeas are cooked, toss it all together

Sweetcorn fritters:

ingredients
- 2x 200g cans of sweetcorn, drained
- 4 sliced spring onions
- 4 tablespoons of gram flour
- 1 teaspoon of paprika
- Handful of chopped fresh coriander
- 1 ½ tablespoons of water
- juice of ½ a lime
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil
- a pinch of salt
- Pinch of salt & pepper

method
1. Place 1 can of drained sweetcorn, the spring onions, coriander, gram flour, paprika, olive oil, water, lime juice and a pinch of salt and pepper into a food processor and blend until a chunky mixture forms.

2. Once the mixture has come together, mix through the remaining sweetcorn.

3. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a pan over a medium heat. Once warm, add a large tablespoon of the fritter mixture, smoothing it out using a wooden spoon.

4. Cook for about 5 minutes on each side, until the fritters are golden brown. You will need to do this in batches. Don’t be tempted to cook them on a higher heat to speed up the process as they will burn on the outside without cooking through the middle.

--------

1/2 a ripe avocado 
1 piece of toast 
Olive oil
Chilli flakes 
Spicy peanut butter 

Either make your own - recipe below - or add a sprinkling of chilli flakes, paprika and maple to a jar of peanut butter, it’s 👌👌👌

Homemade spicy peanut butter 
250g redskin peanuts
½ - 1 teaspoon chili flakes (depending on how much spice you like)
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 tablespoon maple syrup
Pinch of flaky sea salt

Method

Toast the peanuts in the oven at 180C for 12-15 minutes, until darkened, fragrant and beginning to release their oils.

Place in a food processor and mix until smooth and creamy, stopping to take breaks if you are worried about your machine overheating.

Add the chili flakes, smoked paprika, maple syrup and flaky sea salt. It will seize slightly once these are added but turn smooth and glossy again with several more minutes of processing.

Delicious with cucumber sticks, on avocado toast or drizzled over roast vegetables.&nbsp;
 Store in a jar at room temperature for up to three months.

The perfect spring salad - crispy, creamy, full of goodness 🌱 100% plant-based

Full recipe on our holistic wellness app; feel better. Alongside 800 other delicious plant-based recipes 🌱

--------

200g / 7 oz wholewheat spaghetti 
2 large courgettes
15g / ½ oz parsley, finely shredded
15g / ½ oz basil, finely shredded
&nbsp;
For the sauce 
100g / 3.5 oz cashews (shall we soak them?)
1 garlic clove
3 tbsp nutritional yeast
1 tbsp Dijon mustard 
1 lemon, zest and juice 
115ml / 4 oz oat milk 
Salt and pepper
&nbsp;
1 Put the spaghetti on to cook as per the instructions on the packet. While it cooks make the sauce and put your courgette through the spiraliser.
&nbsp;
2 For the sauce, blanch the cashews in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, then drain and place them in a high-speed blender with all the remaining sauce ingredients. Blitz until you have smooth sauce. Season with salt and a good crack of black pepper, adding some more milk or a splash of olive oil if it’s a little thick.
&nbsp;
3 One your spaghetti has cooked, drain it, and put it back into the pan along with the courgettes and sauce, putting it over a medium heat to heat through – about two minutes. Once hot, sprinkle over most of the herbs and toss together so the sauce coats everything. 
&nbsp;
4. Spoon into bowls and top with an extra sprinkling of herbs, a squeeze of lemon and lots of black pepper.

--------

500g redskin peanuts (or same amount of blanched almonds)
100g dark chocolate, melted
60ml maple syrup&nbsp;
Generous pinch flaky sea salt&nbsp;

Method

Roast the peanuts on a baking tray in the oven at 180°C for 1-15 minutes, until darkened, fragrant and beginning to release their oils. Stir them halfway through to ensure even browning.&nbsp;

Place the peanuts in a food processor and mix until smooth and creamy, stopping to take breaks if you fear your machine is overworking.&nbsp;

Add the maple syrup, melted chocolate and flaky sea salt. The mix will seize up slightly but turn smooth and creamy again after several minutes of processing.&nbsp;

Store in a jar at room temperature for up to three months.&nbsp;

*Due to the chocolate it will become firmer over time and will not be as smooth and runny as normal peanut butter - but it will still be spreadable and delicious.

--------

2 large, sweet potatoes, cut into wedges 
1 tbsp olive oil 
1 tsp cumin 
1 tsp paprika

Ingredients
1 clove of garlic, minced
Pinch of red chilli flakes
1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes
1 x 400g tin cannellini beans, drained
Olive oil
Salt 
To serve 
2 slices of bread
Fresh basil
A sprinkling of nutritional yeast

Method
1. Place a heavy bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil and then the garlic and chili, allow to sizzle until fragrant – about 1 minute. Then add the tin of tomatoes, bring to a gentle simmer and turn down the heat to low. Allow to bubble gently, stirring occasionally, until darkened and reduced, about 15-20 minutes. Then add the drained cannellini beans and heat through, adding salt to taste.
&nbsp;
2. Place the bread in the toaster and serve with the beans on top, sprinkling over some fresh basil.
